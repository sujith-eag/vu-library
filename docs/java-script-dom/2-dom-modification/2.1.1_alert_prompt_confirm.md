Functions used to interact with the user in the browser environment.

All these three methods are modal: they pause the script execution and don't allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.

### `alert()`

It shows a message and waits for the user to press 'OK'
The mini window is called a modal window. 
```js
alert('Hello');
```

### `prompt()`

It accepts two arguments
```js
result = prompt(title, [default]);
```
`[]` means that the parameter is optional and not needed.

The visitor can type something in the prompt input field and press OK.
Then we get the text in the `result`. Or they can cancel the input or `esc`, then we get `null` as `result`.
The value received will be in string format. 

```js
let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100);

alert ( `You are ${age} years old`);
```


### `confirm()`

```js
result = confirm(question);
```
The function `confirm` shows a modal window with a `question` and two buttons OK and cancel.
The `result` is `true` is OK is pressed and `false` otherwise.

```js
let admin = confirm("Are you the admin?");

alert(admin);  //  true if Ok is pressed
```
