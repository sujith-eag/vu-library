Manipulating DOM dynamically or on demand

## Events

An event is a signal that something has happened. All DOM nodes generate such signals.
Using `js` we can make the webpage listen and react to these events.


List of the most useful DOM events:

**[[4.1 Mouse Events|Mouse events:]]**
- `click` – when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap).
- `contextmenu` – when the mouse right-clicks on an element.
- `mouseover` / `mouseout` – when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element.
- `mousedown` / `mouseup` – when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element.
- `mousemove` – when the mouse is moved.

**Keyboard events:**
- `keydown` and `keyup` – when a keyboard key is pressed and released.

**Form element events:**
- `submit` – when the visitor submits a `<form>`.
- `focus` – when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an `<input>`.

**Document events:**
- `DOMContentLoaded` – when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.

**CSS events:**
- `transitionend` – when a CSS-animation finishes.

## DOM Events

These allow `js` to add `eventListener` or `eventHandler` to HTML elements.

Here in HTML, `onclick` is the event listener and `myFunction()` is the event handler
```html
<button onclick="myFunction()">CLick Me</button>
<button onclick="alert('hello')">CLick Me</button>
```
In this `JS`, click is the event listener and `myFunction` is the event handler
```js
button.addEventListener("click", myFunction);
```

## Callback

A callback is simply a function that is passed into another function as an argument.
When we pass in `alertFunction()` or `function(e){..}` as an argument to `addEventListener` this is a callback.

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
	console.log(e.target)
});

btn.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
	e.target.style.background = "blue";
});
```
The `e` parameter in that call back function contains an object that references the `event` itself. within that object you have access to many useful properties and methods(functions that live inside an object) such that which mouse button or key was pressed, or information about the even's `target`- the DOM node that was clicked.
