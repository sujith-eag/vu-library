### Creating and Using a Class


#### Example 1: A class to handle Bank withdrawal and Deposits

```python
>>> import sys
>>> class Bank:
...     """Bank related Transactions"""
...     # to initialize name and bank balance instance variables
...     def __init__(self, name, balance=0.0):
...             self.name = name
...             self.balance = balance
...     def deposit(self, amount):
...             self.balance += amount
...             return self.balance
...     def withdraw(self, amount):
...             if amount > self.balance:
...                     print('Low Balance')
...             else:
...                     self.balance -= amount
...             return self.balance
... 
>>> 
>>> name = input( 'Enter name: ' ) 
Enter name: Sujith
>>> b = Bank(name)
>>> 
>>> while(True):
...     print("d -Deposit, w -Withdraw, e -Exit")
...     choice = input("Your Choice: ")
...     if choice == 'e' or choice == 'E':
...             sys.exit()
...     amt = float(input("Enter Amount: ") )
...     if choice == 'd' or choice == 'D':
...             print("Balance after Deposit: ", b.deposit(amt))
...     elif choice == 'w' or choice == 'W':
...             print('Balance after Withdraw: ', b.withdraw(amt))
... 
d -Deposit, w -Withdraw, e -Exit
Your Choice: d
Enter Amount: 1000
Balance after Deposit:  1000.0

d -Deposit, w -Withdraw, e -Exit
Your Choice: d
Enter Amount: 2050
Balance after Deposit:  3050.0

d -Deposit, w -Withdraw, e -Exit
Your Choice: w
Enter Amount: 1253
Balance after Withdraw:  1797.0

d -Deposit, w -Withdraw, e -Exit
Your Choice: e
```


#### Example 2 : **Restaurant Class**

A class called `Restaurant`, which stores the name and type of cuisine of a restaurant, and has methods to describe and open the restaurant.

```python
# Defining the Restaurant class
>>> class Restaurant:
...     """Restaurant related functionality"""
...     def __init__(self, restaurant_name, cuisine_type):
...         """
...         Initializing attributes for the restaurant.
...         """
...         self.restaurant_name = restaurant_name
...         self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type
...     def describe_restaurant(self):
...         """
...         Print a description of the restaurant.
...         """
...         print(f"{self.restaurant_name} has {self.cuisine_type} as its special cuisine.")
...     def open_restaurant(self):
...         """
...         Print a message indicating the restaurant is open.
...         """
...         print(f"\nThe {self.restaurant_name} is open now.")
>>> 

>>> restaurant = Restaurant("ACDC", "Chinese")

>>> restaurant.describe_restaurant()
ACDC has Chinese as its special cuisine.

>>> restaurant.open_restaurant()
The ACDC is open now.

>>> print(f"Where is {restaurant.restaurant_name} with its {restaurant.cuisine_type.title()} cuisine?")
Where is ACDC with its Chinese cuisine?
```

- `__init__()` initializes the attributes `restaurant_name` and `cuisine_type`.
- `describe_restaurant()` prints the description of the restaurant.
- `open_restaurant()` prints a message indicating the restaurant is open.
- The instance `restaurant` is created with `"ACDC"` as the name and `"Chinese"` as the cuisine type.
- Methods are called to describe the restaurant and indicate it's open.

#### Example 3: **Car Class**

A `Car` class where each car has attributes for the make, model, and year, and includes a method to return a descriptive name for the car.

```python
# Defining the Car class
>>> class Car:
...     def __init__(self, make, model, year):
...         self.make = make
...         self.model = model
...         self.year = year
...     def descriptive_name(self):
...         long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
...         return long_name
...
>>> # Creating an instance of the Car class
>>> new_car = Car('Audi', 'A4', '2024')

>>> print(new_car.descriptive_name())
2024 Audi A4

>>> print(new_car.make)
Audi
```

- The `__init__()` method initializes the attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`.
- The `descriptive_name()` method returns a string that combines the `year`, `make`, and `model` of the car.
- `new_car` is an instance of `Car` with the make `'Audi'`, model `'A4'`, and year `'2024'`.
- The descriptive name of the car is printed by calling `new_car.descriptive_name()`, and the `make` attribute is printed directly.

---

##### **Setting a Default Value for an Attribute**

In Python, you can set default values for attributes in the `__init__()` method. This allows you to initialize an attribute without having to pass it as a parameter when creating an instance.

In the following example, we define an attribute `odometer_reading` that always starts at 0 by default. A method `read_odometer()` is provided to read the carâ€™s odometer value.

```python
>>> class Car:
...     def __init__(self, make, model, year):
...  """ Initialize the car object, default odometer reading of 0. """
...         self.make = make
...         self.model = model
...         self.year = year
...         self.odometer_reading = 0  # Default value for odometer reading
...     def descriptive_name(self):
...         long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
...         return long_name
...     def read_odometer(self):
...         print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
...
>>> # Create an instance of Car
>>> new_car = Car('Audi', 'A4', '2024')
>>> print(new_car.descriptive_name())
2024 Audi A4

>>> new_car.read_odometer()
This car has 0 miles on it.
```

- `self.odometer_reading = 0`: This sets the default value of the `odometer_reading` attribute to 0 when a new instance of `Car` is created.
- The `read_odometer()` method prints the current odometer reading.

---

#### **Ways of Modifying Attribute Values**


##### 1. **Modifying an Attribute's Value Directly**

You can change the value of an attribute directly using dot notation.

```python
new_car.odometer_reading = 23  # Direct modification of the odometer reading
```

##### 2. **Modifying an Attribute's Value Through a Method**

Instead of changing an attribute directly, you can use a method to update it. This approach allows you to add logic, such as validation, to ensure that values are correctly updated.

```python
>>> class Car:
...     def __init__(self, make, model, year):
...         self.make = make
...         self.model = model
...         self.year = year
...         self.odometer_reading = 0
...     def descriptive_name(self):
...         long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
...         return long_name
...     def read_odometer(self):
...         print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
...     def update_odometer(self, mileage):
...    """Updating after checking it is not being rolled back """
...         if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:
...             self.odometer_reading = mileage
...         else:
...             print("You can't roll back the odometer.")
...     def increment_odometer(self, miles):
...         if miles >= 0:
...             self.odometer_reading += miles
...         else:
...             print("Odometer value cannot be reduced.")


>>> new_car = Car('Audi', 'A4', '2024')
>>> new_car.odometer_reading = 23 # Direct modification
>>> new_car.update_odometer(2345)

>>> new_car.update_odometer(12)  # Invalid update, will print an error
You can't roll back the odometer.

>>> new_car.increment_odometer(-12) # Invalid increment, will print an error
Odometer value cannot be reduced.

>>> print(new_car.descriptive_name())
2024 Audi A4

>>> new_car.read_odometer()
This car has 2345 miles on it.
```

- **Direct modification**: `new_car.odometer_reading = 23` modifies the attribute directly.
- **`update_odometer()` method**: This method ensures the odometer cannot be rolled back (i.e., it checks if the new mileage is greater than or equal to the current value).
- **`increment_odometer()` method**: This method adds a specific number of miles to the odometer. It ensures the value cannot be negative.

#### **Example 4: Creating Points for 2D Representation**

Here, we create a `Point` class to represent points in a 2D space. This class has methods for translating the point and calculating its distance from the origin.

```python
import math

class Point:
    def __init__(self, a=0, b=0):
        """
        Initialize the point with coordinates (a, b).
        By default, the point is set to (0, 0).
        """
        self.x = a
        self.y = b

    def translate(self, deltax, deltay):
        """
        Translate the point by a certain amount in the x and y directions.
        """
        self.x += deltax
        self.y += deltay

    def distance(self):
        """
        Calculate the distance from the origin (0, 0) using the Pythagorean theorem.
        """
        return math.sqrt(self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2)

    def __str__(self):
        """
        Return a string representation of the point in the format (x, y).
        """
        return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"

    def __add__(self, p):
        """
        Add another point to this point (i.e., point addition).
        """
        return Point(self.x + p.x, self.y + p.y)

# Example usage
p1 = Point(3, 4)  # Point at (3, 4)
p2 = Point(1, 2)  # Point at (1, 2)

# Translate p1 by (2, -3)
p1.translate(2, -3)

# Calculate the distance of p1 from the origin
print(p1.distance())  # Output: 5.0

# Add p1 and p2 to get a new point
p3 = p1 + p2
print(p3)  # Output: (6, 3)
```

- `__init__(self, a=0, b=0)`: Initializes a point with coordinates `(a, b)`, defaulting to `(0, 0)` if no values are provided.
- `translate(self, deltax, deltay)`: Shifts the point by the values `deltax` and `deltay`.
- `distance(self)`: Calculates the distance from the point to the origin `(0, 0)` using the Pythagorean theorem.
- `__str__(self)`: This special method provides a string representation of the point, making it easier to print.
- `__add__(self, p)`: This special method allows for adding two points together using the `+` operator.
