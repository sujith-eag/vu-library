A **dictionary** in Python is a collection of **key-value pairs**. Each key is connected to a specific value, and you can use the key to access its corresponding value.

### **Structure of a Dictionary**

An empty dictionary is created like this:

```python
students = {}
```

- A dictionary is written within curly braces `{}`.
- Each key is connected to its value by a colon `:`.
- Each key-value pair is separated by a comma `,`.

```python
a = {"colour": "green", "points": 5}
```

This dictionary has:
- **Key**: `"colour"` with its **Value**: `"green"`.
- **Key**: `"points"` with its **Value**: `5`.

```python
students = {"name": "Alice", "age": 22, "major": "Computer Science"}
```

The **key** is used to retrieve the corresponding **value**.     

Dictionary like a real-life **word dictionary**, where words (keys) are associated with their meanings (values).      
In programming, dictionaries are useful when there is a need to map values together, which is often more practical than using multiple lists separately.

#### **Difference Between Lists and Dictionaries**

- **Lists** are indexed by numbers (i.e., positions), and the values can be accessed using these indices. 

```python
lst = [13, 24, 54, 77, 33]
```

Here, the positions `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` are used as indices to access corresponding values in the list. The access is only through `range(0, n)`.

- **Dictionaries**, on the other hand, allow you to use **actual words (keys)** as indices. This makes dictionaries more flexible than lists, especially when you need to associate specific keys with values.


Starting from Python 3.7, **dictionaries maintain the order of insertion**. This means that when you iterate over the keys of a dictionary, they will appear in the order in which they were added.

### **Key Characteristics of Dictionary Keys and Values**

1. **Keys**:
    - Keys in a dictionary must be **unique**. If you add a key that already exists, the old value will be overwritten by the new one.
    - Keys must be **immutable**, meaning they cannot be lists, dictionaries, or other mutable types. Valid key types are:
        - **int**, **float**, **bool**, **string**, **tuple**.
2. **Values**:
    - Values in a dictionary can be of any data type.
    - Values can also be **repeated**, unlike keys.


### Crating a dictionary with Key-Value Pairs

To add a new key-value pair to an existing dictionary, simply reference the dictionary by its name, then specify the new key inside square brackets `[]` and assign the value to it.

```python
>>> test ={}
>>> test['Dhawan'] = 84
>>> test['Pujara'] = 16

>>> test
{'Dhawan': 84, 'Pujara': 16}

>>> test['Dhawan'] = 99
>>> test
{'Dhawan': 99, 'Pujara': 16}
```

`'Dhawan'` and `'Pujara'` are the keys, and `84` and `16` are their corresponding values.  The repeated value `Dhawan` got over written.

```python
>>> a = {}
>>> a["x"] = 0
>>> a["y"] = 25
>>> a
{'x': 0, 'y': 25}
```

```python
>>> a = {"colour": "green", "points": 5 }
>>> a["x"] = 0
>>> a["y"] = 25
>>> a
{'colour': 'green', 'points': 5, 'x': 0, 'y': 25}
```

### **Nesting in Dictionaries**

#### Nested Dictionaries

You can create **nested dictionaries**, which means a dictionary inside another dictionary. This allows you to represent more complex data structures where keys can themselves have dictionaries as values.

```python
>>> score = {}
>>> score["Test1"] = {}
>>> score["Test2"] = {}
# there can be multiple keys for a given value
>>> score["Test1"]["Dhawan"] = 84
>>> score["Test1"]["Kohli"] = 200
>>> score["Test2"]["Dhawan"] = 50

>>> score
{'Test1': {'Dhawan': 84, 'Kohli': 200}, 'Test2': {'Dhawan': 50}}
```

#### Nesting Dictionaries in Lists

You can also store **multiple dictionaries inside a list**. This can be useful for grouping several dictionaries together in a collection.

```python
>>> test1 = {}
>>> test2 = {}
>>> test3 = {}
>>> score = [test1, test2, test3]
>>> score
[{}, {}, {}]

>>> type(score)
<class 'list'>
```

#### Nested Dictionaries with Dictionary Keys

We can store dictionaries within other dictionaries using string keys. However, remember that dictionaries themselves are mutable and **unhashable**, so you cannot use a dictionary as a key in another dictionary.

```python
# Error because no key was given
>>> score = {test1, test2, test3 }
TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'

# Key cannot be Dictionary
>>> score = {"test1": test1, "test2": test2, "test3": test3 }
>>> score
{'test1': {}, 'test2': {}, 'test3': {}}

>>> type(score)
<class 'dict'>
```

### **Accessing Values through Key Indexing**

Unlike lists, dictionaries don't use **numeric indexing**. Instead, you access the values by using the **key**.

To access a value in a dictionary, we use the key inside square brackets (`[]`). 
Nested Values of dictionary can be accessed by chain indexing.

```python
>>> score["Test2"]
{'Dhawan': 50}

>>> score["Test1"]
{'Dhawan': 84, 'Kohli': 200}

>>> score["Test1"]["Kohli"]
200
>>> score["Test2"]["Dhawan"]
50
```

- **Indexing with numbers** will not work with dictionaries. Specific key must be used to access values.

---

### **Checking for Key Existence**

The **`in`** or **`not in`** membership operators are used to check whether a specific **key** exists in a dictionary or not.

These operators return `True` if the key is present and `False` if it is not.

```python
>>> score = {'Test1': {'Dhawan': 84, 'Kohli': 200}, 'Test2': {'Dhawan': 50}}

>>> "Dhawan" in score
False
>>> "Kohli" in score
False

>>> "Dhawan" in score["Test1"]
True
>>> "Dhawan" not in score["Test1"]
False
>>> "Kohli" in score["Test1"]
True
>>> "Kohli" in score["Test2"]
False
```

`in` checks whether a **key** exists in the dictionary.
- `"Dhawan" in score` returns `False` because `"Dhawan"` is not a direct key in `score`.
- `"Dhawan" in score["Test1"]` returns `True` because `"Dhawan"` is a key inside the nested dictionary for `"Test1"`.
