List comprehension in Python provides a concise way to create lists based on existing iterables. It represents the creation of a new list from an iterable object (like a list, set, tuple, dictionary, or range) that satisfies a given condition. It is very compact code, usually a single line, and simplifies loops, as well as the process of filtering or transforming data into a new list. 

The syntax is readable and efficient, making it one of the most powerful features of Python when working with lists.

___

**Squaring Numbers using a traditional loop:**
```python
>>> square = []
>>> for i in range(1, 11):
...     square.append(i**2)

>>> square
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

Using list comprehension:
```python
>>> squares = [x**2 for x in range(3, 11)]

>>> squares
[9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

#### **List Comprehension Syntax**

So a list comprehension consists of `[]` square braces, containing an expression up front. after the expression, a for loop and then zero or more if statements can be written.

```python
[expression for item1 in iterable1 if statement1
        for item2 in iterable2 if statement2
        for item3 in iterable3 if statement3 ...]
```

- **expression**: The value or operation that will be applied to each item.
- **item**: The variable that takes each value from the iterable.
- **iterable**: The collection (list, set, dict, tuple, range) that provides the values.
- **condition (optional)**: A filter that only includes items that satisfy the condition.

The result is a new list which contains elements formed as a result of executing the expression according to the for loop and if statements.

### **Examples of List Comprehension**

#### Squaring only Even Numbers

Without any condition:

```python
>>> [x**2 for x in range(3, 11)]
[9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

With a condition to square only even numbers:
```python
>>> [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

Using a step value in `range()`:
```python
>>> [x**2 for x in range(2, 11, 2)]
[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```


#### **Using a Separate Function for Checking Even Numbers**

```python
# Define a function to check if a number is even
>>> def is_even(x):
...     return x % 2 == 0

# List comprehension to square even numbers
>>> squared_evens = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if is_even(x)]
>>> squared_evens
[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

#### **Efficiency of List Comprehension**

List comprehension is efficient because it combines iteration and filtering into a single line. 

```python
# square of even numbers below 100
[square(x) for i in range(100) if is_even(x)]
#   map        generator           filter
```
This is how a sub-list is made without using the words `map` or `filter`.

____

### **More Complex List Comprehensions**

#### Adding each element of a list to each element of another list.

There are no checks but one element from each list is taken automatically similar to a double loop.
```python
>>> x = [10, 20, 30]
>>> y = [1,2,3,4]

>>> [i+j for i in x for j in y]
[11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34]
```

```python
>>> [i+j for i in [10, 20, 30] for j in [1,2,3,4]]
[11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34]
```

The traditional loop version would be:
```python
>>> lst = []
>>> for i in x:
...     for j in y:
...             lst.append(i+j)
... 
>>> lst
[11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34]
```

____

#### **Selecting Numbers Not in Another List**

Using `not in`:
```python
>>> [i for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if i not in [10, 11, 1, 2]]
[3, 4, 5]
```

Indirect assignment:
```python
>>> A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> B = [10, 11, 1, 2]

>>> [i for i in A if i not in B]
[3, 4, 5]
```


#### **String Combinations**

Combining characters from two strings:

```python
>>> [i + j for i in 'ABC' for j in 'DE']
['AD', 'AE', 'BD', 'BE', 'CD', 'CE']
```

#### **Extracting the First Letter of Each Word**

```python
>>> words = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Grapes', 'Orange']
>>> [word[0] for word in words]
['A', 'B', 'G', 'O']
```

___

#### **Advanced Use Cases: Dictionary and Set Comprehensions**

It is also possible to create **dictionary comprehension** and **set comprehension**. For dictionaries, the syntax uses `{}` instead of `[]`.

**Dictionary Comprehension**      
To convert a value to a key and a key to a value in a dictionary:
```python
>>> rev_dict = {value: key for key, value in dict.items()}
```


_____
___

## Advance Problem 

#### **Generating Pythagorean Triples Using List Comprehension**

A **Pythagorean triple** consists of three positive integers x, y, and z that satisfy the equation:  `x^2 + y^2 = z^2`

We can generate all Pythagorean triples where x, y, and z are less than a given number `n` using list comprehension.

The set theory expression for generating these triples can be written as:    
`{(x, y, z) | 1<= x, y, z <=n , x^2 + y^2 = z^2}`

in x, y, z (such that) x, y, z lie b/w 1 and n,  and `x^2 + y^2 = z^2`. 
This defines all valid combinations of x, y, and z where the sum of the squares of x and y equals the square of z.

In set theory, this is called "set comprehension" building a new set from existing sets, this can be extended to lists.


Pythagorean triples with x,y,z below 100
 ```python
[ (x,y,z) for x in range(100) for y in range (100) for z in range(100) if x*x + y*y = z*z]
```

Order of x,y,z is like a nested loop, so the generator can be
```python
 for x in range(100):
    for y in range(100):
        for z in range(100):
```
This will produce copies (3,4,5) and (4,3,5) and values with 0 which isn't a triangle. Change the generator such that later generator depends on the earlier ones
```python

py_triplets = ([ (x,y,z) for x in range(1,100) # x starts from 1
		            for y in range(x,100)  # y is not less than x
		              for z in range(y,100) # z is not less than y
		                if x*x + y*y == z*z  ]  )
```
`(x, y, z)` is mapping, `for x.., y.., z..` are generators, `if ___` is filter


- **Nested loops**: We iterate over all possible values of x, y, and z in the range from 1 to 99.
    - x starts from 1 to avoid unnecessary checks.
    - y starts from x to avoid duplicate triples ( (3, 4, 5) and (4, 3, 5) ).
    - z starts from y to avoid further duplicates.
- **Condition**: We only include the triplet if the equation  `x*x + y*y == z*z` holds true.


```python
[(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (6, 8, 10), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 12, 15), (9, 40, 41), (10, 24, 26), (11, 60, 61), (12, 16, 20), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (14, 48, 50), (15, 20, 25), (15, 36, 39), (16, 30, 34), (16, 63, 65), (18, 24, 30), (18, 80, 82), (20, 21, 29), (20, 48, 52), (21, 28, 35), (21, 72, 75), (24, 32, 40), (24, 45, 51), (24, 70, 74), (25, 60, 65), (27, 36, 45), (28, 45, 53), (30, 40, 50), (30, 72, 78), (32, 60, 68), (33, 44, 55), (33, 56, 65), (35, 84, 91), (36, 48, 60), (36, 77, 85), (39, 52, 65), (39, 80, 89), (40, 42, 58), (40, 75, 85), (42, 56, 70), (45, 60, 75), (48, 55, 73), (48, 64, 80), (51, 68, 85), (54, 72, 90), (57, 76, 95), (60, 63, 87), (65, 72, 97)]
```

___

List comprehension is more **efficient** than traditional for-loops because:

- It avoids the need for explicit appending to a list.
- The code is more compact and readable.
- It is faster, especially when dealing with larger datasets or complex operations.
