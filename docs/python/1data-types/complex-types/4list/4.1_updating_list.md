### Topics covered

1. **Mutable Lists**: Lists are mutable and can be updated directly.
2. **Equality vs Identity**: `==` compares values, `is` compares memory references.
3. **List Slicing**: `list[start:stop:step]` to extract sublists. Supports reverse and step slicing.
4. **Copying Lists**: Use slicing `[:]` to copy a list.
5. **Index Errors**: Out-of-range slices return empty lists, and negative indexing avoids errors.
6. **Concatenation**: Use `+` to combine lists.
7. **f-strings**: Embed list elements into strings using f-strings.

### Updating Lists (Mutable)

Unlike strings, lists in Python are **mutable**, meaning you can change their contents directly.

```python
>>> nested = [[2, [37]], 4, ["hello"]]

>>> nested[1]
4
>>> nested[1] = 7

>>> nested[0][1][0]
37
>>> nested[0][1][0] = 19

>>> nested
[[2, [19]], 7, ['hello']]
```

### Mutable vs Immutable Types

* ***Immutable types**: When you assign one variable to another, a fresh copy is created. Examples include integers, floats, booleans, and strings.

```python
>>> x =5
>>> y = x

>>> x = 7
>>> y
5
# y remains 5 and is unaffected by changes to x
```

- **Mutable types**: When you assign one list to another, both variables point to the same list in memory.

```python
>>> list1 = [1,3,5,7]
>>> list2 = list1

>>> list1[2] = 4
>>> list2
[1, 3, 4, 7]
```

___

#### Equality vs Identity

- `x == y` checks if the values of `x` and `y` are the same.
- `x is y` checks if `x` and `y` refer to the **same object** in memory.

```python
>>> list1 = [1,3,5,7]
>>> list2 = [1,3,5,7]
>>> list3 = list2

>>> list1 == list2
True
>>> list2 == list3
True   # their values are the same

>>> list1 is list2
False  # they are two separate objects in memory
>>> list2 is list3
True   # list2 and list3 refer to the same object
```

### List Slicing in Python

Slicing is used to extract a subset (sublist) from a list, similar to string slicing.
Slice always returns a list even if it is a single element.

The syntax is:
```python
list[start:stop:step]
```
- **`start`**: The index where slicing begins (inclusive).
- **`stop`**: The index where slicing ends (exclusive).
- **`step`**: The number of elements to skip between selections.

### Slicing Examples:

```python
>>> numbers = list(range(10))
>>> numbers
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> numbers[2:5]
[2, 3, 4]

>>> numbers[:4]
[0, 1, 2, 3]    # Slice from Start to Specific Index

>>> numbers[5:]
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # Till end from a Specific Index

>>> numbers[:]   # Full List Slice (copy)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

>>> numbers[::2]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]   # slice with step

>>> numbers[::-1]  # Reversing a list
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

>>> numbers[1:8:2]
[1, 3, 5, 7]     # Slice with Step and Start/Stop

>>> numbers[::3]
[0, 3, 6, 9]

>>> numbers[8:0:-2]
[8, 6, 4, 2]
```

### List vs String Slicing

Although slicing is used both in lists and strings, the behavior of slicing differs slightly.

- **String slicing:** Slicing a string of length 1 returns the character itself.
- **List slicing:** Slicing a list always returns a list, even if you only want one element.

##### 1. String Slicing
```python
>>> h = "hello"

>>> h[0]
'h'
>>> h[0:1]
'h'
```

##### 2. List Slicing
```python
>>> num = [1,2,3,4,5]

>>> num[0]
1
>>> num[0:1]
[1]
```

### Copying Lists Using Slicing

When you assign a list to a new variable, both variables refer to the same list in memory. To create a new copy of the list, slicing can be used.

```python
>>> num = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> list2 = num

>>> num[0]=9
>>> list2
[9, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```python
>>> num = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> list2 = num[:]
>>> num[0]=10

>>> list2
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> num
[10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Index Error Handling

When slicing a list, if you try to access an index that doesnâ€™t exist, Python will not throw an error. Instead, it will return an empty list or the available elements, depending on the slice.

```python
>>> num
[10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> num = [0,1,2,3,4,5]

# Accessing an out-of-range index
>>> num[10:]
[]

# Negative indices handle reverse slices
>>> num[-1]
5
>>> num[-2:]
[4, 5]
```

---

### Using Lists with f-strings

You can easily access elements from a list and incorporate them into an f-string to format output.

```python
>>> cycles=["mountain","road","hybrid"]

>>> message = f"My first cycle was a {cycles[0].title()}."

>>> message
'My first cycle was a Mountain.'
```


---

### Concatenation of Lists

You can concatenate lists using the `+` operator, which creates a new list.

```python
>>> list1 = [1,3,5,7]
>>> list2 = [4,5,6,8]

>>> list1 + list2
[1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8]
# Creates a new list with elements of both lists
```

- Concatenating lists with `+` always creates a new list.

```python
>>> list1 = [1,3,5,7]

>>> list2 = list1

>>> list1 = list1 + [9]

>>> list1
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
>>> list2
[1, 3, 5, 7]
```

Error of trying to concatenate non list items. 
```python
>>> list1 = list1 + 9

TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
```

---

### Index Error

Attempting to access an index outside the range of the list will result in an **IndexError**.

```python
>>> cycles=["mountain","road","hybrid"]

>>> cycles[3]
IndexError: list index out of range

>>> cycles[-1]
'hybrid'
```

To avoid errors when accessing elements from the end of the list, use negative indexing (`-1` for the last element, `-2` for the second-last element, etc.).
