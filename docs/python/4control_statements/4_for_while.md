### 1. 'for' Loop: Iterating Over a Collection

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

**Basic Example 1: Iterating Over a List:**

```python
for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    print("Meow")
```

**Basic Example 2: Using `range()` to Repeat a Fixed Number of Times:**

```python
for i in range(3):  # Iterates over a range of 3 numbers (0, 1, 2)
    print("Meow")
```

**Example 3: Using `range()` to Iterate Over a Sequence of Numbers:**

```python
for i in range(0, n):  # Sequence from 0 to n-1
    # Code to execute
```

### 2. 'while' Loop: Loops Based on Condition

The `while` loop is useful when you don't know how many times the loop should run in advance. It keeps executing as long as the condition evaluates to `True`.

**Decrementing Example:**

```python
i = 3
while i != 0:
    print("Meow")
    i = i - 1
```

**Incrementing Example:**

```python
i = 0
while i != 3:  # Alternatively: while i < 3
    print("Meow")
    i = i + 1  # or i += 1
```

**Using `while` to Write Clear Prompts:**

```python
prompt = "Type this message\n"
prompt += "Add 'quit' to exit\n:"
message = ""
while message != "quit":
    message = input(prompt)
    print(message)
```

**Example of a counter with `while` loop:**

```python
number = 1
while number <= 5:
    print(number)
    number += 1  # Can also be number *= 2 to double the value
```

### 3. Using a Flag to Exit a Loop

A flag is a variable that controls whether the loop continues or stops. Itâ€™s particularly useful when there are multiple conditions to consider.

When many possible events might occur to stop the program, testing all these conditions in a single `while` statement can become complicated. Instead, we can use a flag to simplify this.

The flag acts as a signal to the program. The loop will run as long as the flag is set to `True`, and it will stop when any event sets the flag to `False`. This way, our `while` statement only needs to check one condition: whether the flag is `True`.

Other conditions that could modify the flag can be handled separately in the rest of the program.

```python
prompt = "\nType to have it repeated"
prompt += "\n: "
active = True

while active:  # Loop continues while 'active' is True
    message = input(prompt)
    if message == "quit":
        active = False  # When "quit" is entered, the flag is set to False, ending the loop
    else:
        print(message)
```


This approach keeps the program flow simple, only needing to check the flag condition in the `while` loop.

### 4. Using 'break' to Exit a Loop

The `break` statement immediately exits the loop, regardless of the condition.

```python
prompt = "\nEnter the city you have visited:"
prompt += "\nUse 'quit' to exit. "

while True:  # This loop will run indefinitely until 'break' is encountered
    city = input(prompt)
    if city == "quit":
        break  # Exits the loop when 'quit' is entered
    else:
        print(f"\n{city.title()} is lovely")
```

---

### 5. Using 'continue' in a Loop

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one.

**Example:**

```python
number = 0

while number < 10:
    number += 1
    if number % 2 == 0:  # Skips even numbers
        continue
    else:
        print(number)  # Prints only odd numbers
```

### 6. Modifying Lists Inside Loops

You can use a `while` loop to modify lists as you work through them. For example, you can move items from one list to another or remove specific values.

**Example 1: Moving Items Between Lists:**

```python
unconfirmed_users = ['alice', 'brian', 'candace']
confirmed_users = []

while unconfirmed_users:  # Continues as long as the list is not empty
    user = unconfirmed_users.pop()
    print(f"Verifying User: {user.title()}")
    confirmed_users.append(user)

print("\nThe following users have been verified:")
for user in confirmed_users:
    print(f"{user.title()}")
```

**Example 2: Removing Specific Values from a List:**

```python
pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']
print(pets)

while "cat" in pets:
    pets.remove("cat")  # Removes the first instance of "cat"
print(pets)
```

### 7. Filling a Dictionary with User Input

A `while` loop can be used to collect multiple user inputs and store them in a dictionary.

```python
responses = {}
polling = True

while polling:
    name = input("\nWhat's your name: ")
    response = input("What mountain would you like to climb someday? ")
    responses[name] = response  # Add user response to dictionary

    repeat = input("\nWould you like another to take this poll? (y/n): ")
    if repeat == "n":
        polling = False  # Ends the loop when 'n' is entered

print("\n-- Poll Results --")
for name, response in responses.items():
    print(f"{name.title()} wants to climb {response.title()}.")
```

### 8. Functions with Loops

You can define functions that use loops to perform repetitive tasks.

```python
def main():
    number = get_number()
    meow(number)

def get_number():
    while True:
        n = int(input("What's n? "))
        if n > 0:
            break  # Ensures that n is positive
    return n

def meow(n):
    for _ in range(n):  # Repeats n times
        print("Meow")

main()
```

### 9. Simulating a 'for' Loop with a 'while' Loop

Sometimes you may want to simulate a `for` loop using a `while` loop.

**Example 1: Simulating `for` with a Range:**

```python
n = i
while n < j:
    statement
    n += 1
```

**Example 2: Simulating Iterating Over a List:**

```python
i = 0
while i < len(l):
    n = l[i]
    statement
    i += 1
```
