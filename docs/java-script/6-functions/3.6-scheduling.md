## **Scheduling Function Calls with `setTimeout` and `setInterval`**

JavaScript provides the ability to schedule functions to be executed **later** or **repeatedly** using two methods: **`setTimeout`** and **`setInterval`**. 

- `setTimeout` allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.

- `setInterval` allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

---

### **setTimeout( )**

The **`setTimeout()`** method allows you to schedule a function to run **once** after a specified delay.
```js
let timerId = setTimeout(func|code, delay, [arg1], [arg2], ...);
```

- **`func|code`**: Function or string of code to execute after the delay. Usually it's a function.
- **`delay`**: The time to wait (in milliseconds) before executing the function. The default is `0` (run immediately) (1000 ms = 1 second).
- **`arg1`, `arg2`, ...**: Arguments to pass to the function when it executes (optional).

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert('Hello');
}

setTimeout(sayHi, 1000);  // Executes sayHi after 1 second (1000 ms)
```


You can pass arguments to the function using `setTimeout`.
```js
function sayHi(phrase, who) {
  alert(phrase + ', ' + who);
}

setTimeout(sayHi, 1000, "Hello", "John"); // "Hello, John"
```

Here, `sayHi` is called with `"Hello"` and `"John"` after 1 second.

If the first argument is a string, the `js` creates a function from it.

#### **Using Arrow Functions (Best Practice):**

It's better to use arrow functions rather than passing a string of code:

```js
setTimeout(() => alert('Hello'), 1000);
```

Passing a string is **not recommended** because it has security and performance issues. It is safer and clearer to use a function or an arrow function.

#### **Common Mistake (Calling Function Immediately):**

When you **call** the function immediately, it doesn't work as expected. You need to pass the function reference, not the result of its execution.

```js
setTimeout(sayHi(), 1000);  // WRONG! sayHi is executed immediately

// Correct way:
setTimeout(sayHi, 1000);  // Pass the function reference, don't call it
```
`setTimeout` expects a reference to a function. And here `sayHi()` runs the function, and the _result of its execution_ is passed to `setTimeout`.

In the wrong example, `sayHi()` is executed immediately, and its return value (which is `undefined`) is passed to `setTimeout`. You should pass `sayHi` **without parentheses** to ensure it is executed later.

### **clearTimeout( )**

You can cancel a scheduled `setTimeout()` function before it executes by using `clearTimeout()`.

```js
clearTimeout(timerId);
```

- **`timerId`** is the identifier returned by `setTimeout`.

```js
let timerId = setTimeout(() => alert("never happens"), 1000);

clearTimeout(timerId);  // This cancels the timeout before it executes
```

Even though `clearTimeout(timerId)` is called, the alert will never show because the execution was canceled.

---

### **setInterval( )**

The **`setInterval()`** method is similar to `setTimeout`, but it runs the function **repeatedly** at the specified interval.

```js
let timerId = setInterval(func, delay, [arg1], [arg2], ...);
```

- **`func`**: The function to execute repeatedly.
- **`delay`**: The time (in milliseconds) between each execution of the function.
- **`arg1`, `arg2`, ...**: Arguments to pass to the function (optional).

```js
let timerId = setInterval(() => alert('tick'), 2000);  // Alerts "tick" every 2 seconds
```

#### **Stopping the Interval:**

You can stop the interval by calling `clearInterval()` and passing the `timerId` returned by `setInterval`.

```js
let timerId = setInterval(() => alert('tick'), 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
  clearInterval(timerId);  // Stops the interval after 5 seconds
  alert('stop');
}, 5000);
```
- The `"tick"` alert happens every 2 seconds.
- After 5 seconds, the interval is cleared, and `"stop"` is shown.

### **Behavior in Browsers:**
- In most browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, the internal timer continues to run even when a modal window (`alert`, `confirm`, etc.) is open.
- So, if you don’t dismiss the alert for a while, the next `"tick"` will be shown immediately after you close the current one, making the interval appear shorter.

### **Nested `setTimeout()`**

[Nested setTimeout](https://javascript.info/settimeout-setinterval#nested-settimeout) 

You can schedule the next function call **within** the function itself, creating a loop that behaves similarly to `setInterval()`, but with more flexibility.

```js
let timerId = setTimeout(function tick() {
  alert('tick');
  timerId = setTimeout(tick, 2000);  // Schedules the next tick after 2 seconds
}, 2000);
```

This method allows you to control when the next function is called based on the results of the current execution. For example, you might want to vary the interval or conditionally stop the execution.

The key difference is that with `setInterval`, the next interval is always scheduled immediately, but with nested `setTimeout`, you can choose to delay the next call further or conditionally stop it based on some logic.

### **Important Notes on `setTimeout` and `setInterval`:**

1. **Timers are not guaranteed to be precise.** The delay is the minimum time before execution, and the actual execution might happen later due to factors like system load, other running scripts, or the browser's event loop.
   
2. **Avoid using `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for high-precision tasks.** For tasks that require high precision (like animations or real-time operations), it's better to use `requestAnimationFrame` or other appropriate APIs.

3. **Memory leaks can occur.** If intervals or timeouts are not cleared properly, they can continue to run in the background, consuming memory and resources.

---

### **Summary**

- `setTimeout(func, delay)` runs `func` once after `delay` milliseconds.
- `setInterval(func, delay)` runs `func` repeatedly every `delay` milliseconds.
- Use `clearTimeout(timerId)` or `clearInterval(timerId)` to stop a scheduled timeout or interval.
- Nested `setTimeout()` provides more flexibility over `setInterval()` and can help in cases where you need to control the timing more precisely.
