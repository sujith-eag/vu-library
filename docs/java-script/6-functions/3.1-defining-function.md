There are **three ways** to define a function in JavaScript:    
**Function Expressions**, **Function Declarations**, and **Arrow Functions**.

---

### **1. Function Expression**

A **Function Expression** is when a function is defined as part of an expression.   
The function itself is assigned to a variable, which can then be called later.   
Since the function is part of an expression, it cannot be used before it is defined.
This allows for creating a function in the middle of any expression.

As the function creation happens in the context of the assignment expression (to the right side of `=`), this is a _Function Expression_.

  - The function is created when the execution reaches it, meaning you **cannot call it before it is declared**.
  - Function Expressions are **anonymous** or **named** functions assigned to variables.

```js
const square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

console.log(square(12)); // 144
```
Function for `square` is defined as an expression and assigned to the variable `square`. It can be called later after the definition.

- A function starts with the `function` keyword, followed by a set of **parameters** inside parentheses `()`, and then a **body** inside curly braces `{}`.
- Functions can have **no parameters** or **multiple parameters**.
- The `return` keyword is used to return a value from the function. If no `return` statement is provided, the function returns `undefined` by default.

Example with no parameters:
```js
const makeNoise = function() {
  console.log("Ping!");
};
makeNoise(); // Ping!
```

Example with multiple parameters:
```js
const roundTo = function(n, step) {
  let remainder = n % step;
  return n - remainder + (remainder < step / 2 ? 0 : step);
};

console.log(roundTo(23, 10)); // 20
```
If the `remainder` is less than half of `step`, it rounds down; otherwise, it rounds up.

#### Python Equivalent:
```python
def makeNoise():
    print("Ping!")

makeNoise()

def roundTo(n, step):
    remainder = n % step
    if remainder >= step / 2:
        return (n - remainder) + step
    return (n - remainder)

print(roundTo(23, 10)) # 20
```

**Important Note**:  
- A **Function Expression** typically ends with a **semicolon** (`;`) since it's part of an assignment statement. But function declaration do not.

A Function Expression is created here as `function(…) {…}` inside the `=` assignment statement:  `let sayHi = …;`.
The semicolon `;` is recommended at the end of the statement, it’s not a part of the function syntax.
  ```js
  let sayHi = function() {
    // function body
  }; // semicolon required
  ```

---

### **2. Function Declaration**

A **Function Declaration** is the classic way to define a function in JavaScript. It starts with the `function` keyword, followed by the **function name**, **parameters**, and the **function body** enclosed in curly braces.
  ```js
  function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...parameterN) {
    // body
  }
  ```

```js
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
console.log(square(12)); // 144

//function expression
let square = function(x) {
	return x * x;
};
```
  - A **Function Declaration** **does not require a semicolon** after it, because it's a complete statement by itself.
  - The **function name** must be valid (cannot start with a number, etc.).
  - The function is created when the script is **loaded** and is **hoisted** to the top of its scope. This means it can be called **before its actual declaration** in the code.

#### **Hoisting Behavior**:  
Function Declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, so they can be called before they are defined in the code. Function Expressions, on the other hand, are **not hoisted** and can only be called after they are defined.

```js
console.log("The future says: ", future());

function future() {
  return "You will never have flying cars";
}
```
In this example, the function `future()` can be called before it's defined because the function declaration is hoisted to the top.

  - **Function Declarations** are useful when you want your functions to be accessible throughout the entire scope.
  - **Function Expressions** are useful when you need to define functions **dynamically** (such as inside loops, conditionals, or callbacks).



#### Function Declarations and Scope

- A **Function Declaration** is **visible** throughout the **entire scope** it’s defined in (whether in a block, function, or global scope).
- If a function is declared within a block (e.g., inside `if` or `for` statements), it's only visible **inside that block**, not outside of it. So calling it from outside is not possible.

So better to declare a function using `function expression` outside a code block first, and reassign it inside the code block. This makes the function visible from outside also.

***Function Declaration Inside Code Blocks:***
```js
let age = 18;

let welcome;  // Declare the variable to hold the function

if (age < 18) {
  welcome = function() {
    alert("Hello");
  };
} else {
  welcome = function() {
    alert("Greetings");
  };
}

welcome(); // Outputs either "Hello" or "Greetings" based on the age
```

- **Alternative with Ternary Operator**:
```js
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome = (age < 18)
  ? function() { alert("Hello"); }
  : function() { alert("Greetings"); };

welcome(); // Outputs based on age
```

### **Key Differences Between Function Expressions and Function Declarations**

| Feature       | **Function Declaration**                              | **Function Expression**                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hoisting**  | Hoisted to the top, can be called before declaration. | Not hoisted, can only be called after definition.                          |
| **Syntax**    | `function name() {}`                                  | `let name = function() {}`                                                 |
| **Semicolon** | No semicolon required after function body.            | Semicolon is required after function expression.                           |
| **Use Case**  | Ideal for globally accessible functions.              | Ideal for dynamically defined functions or passing functions as arguments. |

### **Summary**

- **Function Expressions** are functions assigned to variables and are only usable after their definition.
- **Function Declarations** are hoisted, meaning they can be used before the declaration in the code.
- Choose **Function Declarations** for global accessibility and **Function Expressions** for dynamic or localized functions.
