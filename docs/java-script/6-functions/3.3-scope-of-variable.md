## **Bindings and Scopes**

In JavaScript, the **scope** refers to the context in which variables (bindings) are accessible. 

### **Local Variables**

A **local variable** is declared inside a function or block (e.g., `{}`) and is only accessible within that function or block. Each time the function is called, a new instance of the local variables is created.

```js
function showMessage() {
  let message = "Hello, JS";
  alert(message);
}

showMessage();  // Hello, JS
alert(message);  // Error: message is not defined outside the function
```
`message` is **local** to the `showMessage()` function, so it cannot be accessed outside of it.

Variables declared inside control structures like `if`, `for`, or `while` using `let` or `const` are also block-scoped, meaning they are only visible within that block.

```js
if (true) {
  let blockScoped = "This is block-scoped";
  console.log(blockScoped);  // This will work inside the block
}
console.log(blockScoped);  // Error: blockScoped is not defined outside the block
```

Variables declared using `var`, however, have a function scope, meaning they are visible within the function and outside of it if not enclosed in any other block.

### **Outer Variables (Closure)**

A function in JavaScript can access variables from its **outer scope** (the scope in which it was defined). This allows functions to modify and use variables from the outer environment. This concept is often called **closure**.

```js
let userName = 'John';

function showMessage() {
  let message = "Hello, " + userName; // Accesses outer variable `userName`
  alert(message);
}

showMessage();  // Hello, John
```

You can also **modify** outer variables inside a function:

```js
let userName = 'John';

function showMessage() {
  userName = "Bob";   // Outer variable `userName` is overwritten
  let message = "Hello, " + userName;
  alert(message);  // Hello, Bob
}

alert(userName);  // John (before the function call)
showMessage();
alert(userName);  // Bob (after the function call)
```

If the function defines a variable with the same name as an outer variable, the inner variable **shadows** the outer one, meaning the function will use the local variable instead of the outer one.

```js
let userName = 'John';

function showMessage() {
  let userName = "Bob";  // Local variable shadows the outer variable
  let message = "Hello, " + userName;
  alert(message);  // Hello, Bob
}

alert(userName);  // John
showMessage();    // Hello, Bob
alert(userName);  // John
```

### **Nested Scope**

In JavaScript, functions and blocks can be nested within other functions and blocks, creating **nested scopes**. Each function or block can access variables from its outer scope, but outer scopes cannot access variables from inner scopes.

```js
const hummus = function(factor) {
  const ingredient = function(amount, unit, name) {
    let ingredientAmount = amount * factor;
    if (ingredientAmount > 1) {
      unit += "s"; // Pluralize the unit if the amount is greater than 1
    }
    console.log(`${ingredientAmount} ${unit} of ${name}`);
  };

  ingredient(1, "can", "Chickpeas");
  ingredient(0.25, "cup", "Tahini");
  ingredient(0.25, "cup", "Lemon Juice");
};

hummus(1);  // Calls hummus and prints ingredient details
```

- The **inner function** `ingredient` can access the `factor` argument of the outer `hummus` function, because the inner function is within the scope of the outer function.
- The **outer function** cannot access the local bindings of the inner function, such as `ingredientAmount`.

This form of scoping is called **lexical scoping**, meaning that the scope of variables is determined by the position of functions and blocks in the code.

### **Making a Counter (Closure Example)**

A common example of using closures is creating a **counter function**, which keeps track of the count even after the function has returned. This works because the inner function maintains a reference to the variables in the outer function's scope.

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    return count++;  // Accesses and modifies the `count` variable
  };
}

let counter = makeCounter();

alert(counter());  // 0
alert(counter());  // 1
alert(counter());  // 2
```

Here, the inner function "remembers" the `count` variable even after the `makeCounter()` function has finished executing. This is an example of a closure, where the inner function has access to the variables of its outer function.

### **Global Variables and the Global Object**

A **global variable** is a variable that is declared outside any function or block. Its scope is the entire program, meaning it is accessible from any function or block within that program (unless shadowed by a local variable with the same name).

```js
let globalVar = 'I am a global variable';

function checkGlobal() {
  alert(globalVar);  // Accessible inside any function
}

checkGlobal();  // I am a global variable
```

Global variables are often stored in a global object:
- In a browser, the global object is **`window`**.
- In Node.js, the global object is **`global`**.
- For better compatibility across different environments (e.g., browsers, Node.js), the `globalThis` keyword is used, which provides a standard way to access the global object in any JavaScript environment.

```js
// Example in a browser environment
window.globalVar = "I am a global variable";  // This variable is a property of the `window` object

console.log(globalThis.globalVar);  // I am a global variable (works in both Node.js and browsers)
```

**Best Practices**:
- **Minimize the use of global variables**. Having many global variables can lead to potential conflicts and bugs, especially in large applications.
- Local variables should be preferred wherever possible to avoid polluting the global scope.

### **Summary of Scoping Rules**

1. **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function or block are **local** and only accessible within that function or block.
2. **Outer Scope**: Functions can access variables from their outer scope. This is known as **lexical scoping**.
3. **Shadowing**: If a local variable has the same name as an outer variable, the local variable **shadows** the outer variable within that function or block.
4. **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function or block are **global** and accessible from anywhere in the program. In a browser, they are properties of the `window` object.
5. **Closure**: A function that **remembers** the environment in which it was created, including variables from its outer scope.
