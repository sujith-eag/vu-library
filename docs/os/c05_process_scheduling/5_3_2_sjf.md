The **Shortest Job First (SJF)** scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process with the shortest next CPU burst. The process with the smallest next burst time is given priority when the CPU becomes available.     
If two processes have the same next CPU burst, **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)** is used to break the tie.

- A more appropriate term for this algorithm would be **Shortest-Next-CPU-Burst** scheduling, as it relies on the length of the **next CPU burst** of a process, rather than its total CPU burst time.

**Optimality**:  
- The **SJF algorithm** is **provably optimal**, meaning it minimizes the **average waiting time** for a given set of processes.  
- Moving shorter processes ahead of longer ones reduces the waiting time of short processes more than it increases the waiting time of long processes, leading to a **decrease in average waiting time**.

### Preemptive vs Nonpreemptive SJF:

- **Nonpreemptive SJF**: Once a process starts executing, it continues until it finishes its CPU burst, even if a new process arrives with a shorter burst.
  
- **Preemptive SJF**: If a new process arrives with a shorter CPU burst than the remaining burst of the currently running process, the CPU is **preempted** and allocated to the new process.  
  - **Preemptive SJF** is also known as **Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF)** scheduling.

### Example 1 : Preemptive SJF (SRTF)

**Processes**:  
- **P1**: Arrival Time = 0 ms, Burst Time = 8 ms  
- **P2**: Arrival Time = 1 ms, Burst Time = 4 ms  
- **P3**: Arrival Time = 2 ms, Burst Time = 3 ms  
- **P4**: Arrival Time = 3 ms, Burst Time = 2 ms  

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

| 1    | P2              | 4                    | P2 arrives; P1 has 7 ms left, P2 has 4 ms; P2 preempts P1. |

#### **Challenges with Implementation**:  

- While **SJF** is optimal, it is not directly implementable in short-term CPU scheduling since the **next CPU burst** is unknown.
- We can approximate the next CPU burst by predicting its length based on previous bursts.

**Predicting the Next CPU Burst:**

The next CPU burst is generally predicted as an **exponential average** of the lengths of previous CPU bursts. The formula for the prediction is:

```
T(n+1) = α * Tn + (1 - α) * Tn
```

Where:
- `Tn` = length of the nth CPU burst
- `T(n+1)` = predicted value for the next CPU burst
- `α` = weighting factor (0 ≤ α ≤ 1)

**Interpretation of α**:
- If `α = 0`, then `T(n+1) = Tn`, meaning only the most recent CPU burst is considered.
- If `α = 1`, then `T(n+1) = Tn`, meaning only the most recent burst is considered, with no weight given to past history.
- Typically, `α = 0.5`, meaning recent and past bursts are equally weighted.

The initial value of `T0` can be set as a constant or as the system's overall average.
