#### 1.11.1 Traditional Computing

Traditional computing refers to the setup where computing resources, such as servers and workstations, are located locally in a company or institution. Web technologies and increasing WAN (Wide Area Network) bandwidth are expanding the boundaries of traditional computing.

- Companies establish **portals** to provide web access to their internal servers, improving accessibility and collaboration.
- **Network Computers (NCs)** or **Thin Clients** are now used in place of traditional workstations. These terminals mainly handle web-based computing and have limited local processing power. NCs are ideal for environments where:
  - More security is required.
  - Easier maintenance and management are desired.
  
This shift towards thin clients helps reduce the complexity and cost of maintaining individual workstations, as most tasks are handled on centralized servers.

#### 1.11.3 Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the user as a single system. These systems are designed to distribute workloads across multiple machines, providing benefits in terms of reliability, scalability, and performance.

- **Examples**: Cloud services, large-scale web applications
- Key Features:
  - **Fault Tolerance**: If one node fails, others can continue the task.
  - **Scalability**: More machines can be added to increase computational power.
  - **Resource Sharing**: Multiple devices can share resources like storage, processing power, and data.
  
Distributed systems rely heavily on networked communication and require sophisticated OS management to ensure that the entire system functions efficiently.

---

#### 1.11.4 Client-Server Computing

In client-server computing, tasks are divided between service providers (servers) and requesters (clients).

- **Clients**: These are devices or programs that request services or resources from a server.
- **Servers**: These are machines or applications that provide services, data, or resources to clients over a network.
  
**Examples**: 
- A web browser (client) requesting a webpage from a web server.
- An email client (client) requesting and receiving emails from an email server.

Key benefits of client-server architecture:
  - Centralized data management and security.
  - Efficient use of resources.
  
The OS in client-server systems manages both the server-side and client-side processes, ensuring smooth communication and operation.

---

#### 1.11.5 Peer-to-Peer Computing

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing refers to a network model in which each participant (node) acts both as a client and a server, sharing resources with other nodes.

- **Decentralization**: There is no central server. All nodes are equal and share resources.
- **File Sharing**: Popular for file-sharing systems like BitTorrent, where files are distributed across multiple peers.
  
Key Advantages:
  - Scalability and resilience due to the lack of a single point of failure.
  - Direct communication between peers, reducing network congestion.

However, P2P systems can be less secure compared to client-server models because data is directly exchanged between users.

---

#### 1.11.6 Virtualization

Virtualization refers to the technology that enables running multiple virtual operating systems (VMs) on a single physical machine.

- **Emulation**: In emulation, the CPU architecture of the host machine is different from the guest machine. It allows programs written for one system to run on a completely different one (e.g., Apple's Rosetta emulator enabling software built for IBM architecture to run on Intel processors).
- **Interpretation**: This involves running programs in a non-native format, often by translating high-level code into a language understood by the host machine (e.g., Java being interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM). (Computer language is not compiled to native code but instead is either executed in its high-level form or translated to an intermediate form.)
  
In contrast to full emulation, virtualization runs a guest OS natively on the host's hardware, allowing for efficient resource utilization.

Key Benefits:
  - Allows multiple OS environments on a single machine.
  - Facilitates better resource management and isolation.
  - Enables testing and development of different OS setups without needing separate hardware.

{{< callout note >}}
Java is always interpreted. Interpretation is a form of emulation, the high level language code is translated to native CPU instructions, emulating a theoretical virtual machine on which that language could run natively.

Java programs are run on "Java virtual machines", but technically those virtual machines are Java emulators.
