# My Practice Projects

This is a collection of projects that I've implemented as part of my learning journey. Each project grows with my development skills, utilizing **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and growing into **Frameworks** to create interactive and functional applications. Feel free to explore each project!
