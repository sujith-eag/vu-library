# IPTables – Linux Firewall Configuration for Cybersecurity

## 1. Introduction to IPTables

`iptables` is a powerful command-line utility used in Linux systems to configure and manage the kernel-level **netfilter firewall**.

### Key Use Cases:

- **Packet Filtering** – decide which traffic to allow or block
    
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** – modify IP addresses in packets
    
- **Traffic Redirection** – route traffic to specific ports or hosts
    
- **Logging** – monitor traffic for auditing or threat detection
    

Used extensively in **cybersecurity** to:

- Harden systems against unauthorized access
    
- Drop malicious packets
    
- Control data exfiltration/infiltration
    

#### Installation and Version

Install `iptables` and check its version:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables

iptables --version
```

## 2. Core Concepts of IPTables

### Tables

IPTables is structured around **tables**, each with a specific function:

| Table      | Purpose                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filter`   | Default table for allowing or blocking packets, Packet Filtering (ACCEPT, DROP)              |
| `nat`      | For modifying packet source/destination (e.g., port forwarding, SNAT)                        |
| `mangle`   | Modify packet headers (QoS, TTL, etc.)                                                       |
| `raw`      | Used to configure exemptions from connection tracking                                        |
| `security` | Interface with security modules (like SELinux). For mandatory access control (MAC) filtering |

**Common default table:** `filter`

---

### Chains

Chains are predefined sequences of rules where packets are checked. Each table consists of chains:

| Chain         | Direction                                      | Typical Use                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `INPUT`       | Inbound to local machine. Incoming packets     | Control traffic to host itself. filter |
| `OUTPUT`      | Outbound from local machine. Outgoing Packet   | Outgoing connections from host. filter |
| `FORWARD`     | Routed through the host                        | Useful in gateway/routers. filter      |
| `PREROUTING`  | Before routing decisions. Alter before routing | Used with DNAT. mangle                 |
| `POSTROUTING` | After routing decisions. Alter after routing   | Used with SNAT/MASQUERADE. mangle      |

---

### Rules

A **rule** defines:

- What to match (source IP, protocol, port, etc.)
    
- What action to take if matched (target)
    
#### Targets (Actions)

|Target|Description|
|---|---|
|`ACCEPT`|Allow packet through|
|`DROP`|Silently discard the packet|
|`REJECT`|Discard and reply with ICMP error|
|`LOG`|Log packet details to `/var/log/syslog`|
|`SNAT`|Source NAT (used to mask source IP when sending out)|
|`DNAT`|Destination NAT (used for port forwarding to internal servers)|
|`MASQUERADE`|Dynamic SNAT (used when IP is assigned dynamically like via DHCP/PPP)|

## 3. Basic Command Structure

```bash
iptables [options] [chain] [command] [match criteria] [target]
```

**Example:**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP
```

- `-A INPUT`: Append to INPUT chain
    
- `-s 192.168.1.100`: Source IP to match
    
- `-j DROP`: Drop the matching packet
    

## 4. Common Commands

### List All Rules

```bash
sudo iptables -L -n -v
```

- `-L`: List rules in all chains
    
- `-n`: Don't resolve DNS (faster)
    
- `-v`: Verbose output with packet counters
    

---

### Flush All Rules

```bash
sudo iptables -F
```

Removes all rules in all chains (use with caution).

---

### Save and Restore Rules (Debian/Ubuntu)

Save rules across reboots:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

Restore saved rules:

```bash
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```


## 5. Practical Use Cases in Cybersecurity

### Block All Ping (ICMP) Requests

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
```

This drops all ICMP echo requests (commonly used by `ping`). Useful for making a system invisible on a network.

---

### Allow Ping from a Specific Host

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -s 172.1.27.103 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

Allows ICMP requests only from a specific IP (e.g., an admin or monitoring server).

---

### Accept All ICMP Requests

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```


### Drop All Connections from a Malicious IP

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 10.10.10.5 -j DROP
```

This blocks all packets from the given source IP.

---

### Open SSH Port (22) to Avoid Getting Locked Out

Always add this before setting restrictive rules:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

---

### Monitor Incoming ICMP (Ping) Packets

Use `tcpdump` to view real-time ping packets:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
```

Replace `eno1` with your actual network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).


## 6. NAT and Port Forwarding

### Redirect Port 80 to Port 8080

Useful when running a service on 8080 but want it accessible on standard HTTP port.

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

---

### SNAT – Change Source IP

Used for outbound traffic behind a static public IP:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 203.0.113.5
```

---

### MASQUERADE – NAT for Dynamic IP (e.g., DHCP)

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Commonly used for sharing internet in home networks.

---

## 7. Security Hardening Tips

### Log Suspicious Traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 23 -j LOG --log-prefix "TELNET attempt: "
```

Detect attempts to use Telnet (a highly insecure protocol).

---

### Rate-Limit SSH to Prevent Brute Force

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m limit --limit 3/min -j ACCEPT
```

Allows only 3 SSH connections per minute — helps mitigate brute force attacks.

---

## 8. Managing IPTables with Other Tools

|Tool|Use Case|
|---|---|
|`ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall)|Easier syntax, used in Ubuntu systems|
|`firewalld`|Zone-based dynamic firewall (CentOS/RHEL)|
|`iptables-persistent`|Automatically restore rules on boot|

### Example: UFW for Simplicity

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22          # Allow SSH
sudo ufw deny from 192.168.1.100   # Deny specific IP
sudo ufw enable
```


## Best Practices

- Always **allow essential ports** (e.g., SSH) before applying restrictive rules
    
- Regularly **audit your firewall rules** with `iptables -L -n -v`
    
- Use **logging** to detect suspicious or unexpected traffic
    
- Combine IPTables with tools like **Fail2Ban**, **Snort**, or **Suricata** for intrusion detection
