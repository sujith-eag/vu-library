**Cracker**: a person who breaks into computer. Many sites are developed to supplying crackers with programs that allow them to crack computers. Some of these programs
contain dictionaries for guessing passwords

**Phreaking**: This is the art of breaking into phone or other communications systems.

**Cracker tools**: These programs used to break into computers. Crackers tools are widely distributed on the Internet. They include password crackers, Trojans, viruses, war dialers and worms.


### Vulnerabilities

1. Inadequate border protection (border as in the sense of network periphery);
2. Remote access servers (RASs) with weak access controls;
3. Application servers with well-known exploits;
4. Misconfigured systems and systems with default configurations.


## Attack Planning

Criminals use many methods and tools to locate the vulnerabilities of their target. The target can be an individual and/or an organization. 

Criminals plan passive and active attacks.

**Phases Involved in Planning Cybercrime:**

1. Reconnaissance (information gathering) is the first phase and is treated as passive attacks.

2. Scanning and scrutinizing the gathered information for the validity of the information as well as to identify the existing vulnerabilities.

3. Launching an attack (gaining and maintaining the system access).


### Reconnaissance

The literal meaning of "Reconnaissance" is an act of reconnoitering - explore, often with the goal of finding something or somebody (especially to gain information about an enemy or potential enemy).

In the world of "hacking," reconnaissance phase begins with "Footprinting" - this is the preparation toward pre attack phase, and involves accumulating data about the target's environment and computer architecture to find ways to intrude into that environment.

Footprinting gives an overview about system vulnerabilities and provides a judgment about possible exploitation of those vulnerabilities.

The objective of this preparatory phase is to understand the system, its networking ports and services, and any other aspects of its security that are needful for launching the attack.


An attacker attempts to gather information in two phases: passive and active attacks.

### Active attacks

An attack where the attacker modifies, disrupts, or manipulates data or
systems. It aims to alter or damage the target's resources.

Active attacks are usually used to alter the system (i.e., computer network). It may affect the availability, integrity and authenticity of data.

An active attack involves probing the network to discover individual hosts to confirm the information (IP addresses, operating system type and version, and services on the network) gathered in the passive attack phase.

It involves the risk of detection and is also called "Rattling the doorknobs“ or “Active reconnaissance."

Active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to an attacker about security measures in place (e.g., whether the front door is locked?), but the process can also increase the chance of being caught or raise a suspicion.

* Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): Altering messages in real time between two parties.
* DDoS Attack: Overloading a server or network to make it unavailable.
* Website Defacement: Changing the content of a public website.
* SQL Injection: Modifying a database query to extract or destroy data.

### Passive attacks

A passive attack involves gathering information about a target without his/her (individual's or company's) knowledge.

An attack where the attacker intercepts or monitors data without altering it and gains information about the target. The aim is to gather information secretly.

Searching online, Social media profile, Organisation sites, Blogs and job profiles

* Eavesdropping: Listening to unencrypted network traffic.
* Traffic Analysis: Observing communication patterns and data flow.
* Keylogging: Capturing keyboard input without user knowledge.
* Packet Sniffing: Intercepting network packets to read sensitive data.

## Scanning and Scrutinizing Gathered Information

For gathering information about the target Scanning is a key step

1. Port scanning: Identify open/close ports and services.
2. Network scanning: Understand IP Addresses and related information about the computer network
3. Vulnerability scanning: Understand the existing weaknesses in the system.


## Tools used 

Nmap



## Port

A port is an interface on a computer to which one can connect a device. TCP/IP Protocol suite made out of the two protocols, TCP and UDP, is used universally to communicate on the Internet.

A port is a place where information goes in and out of a computer and so on, with port scan one can identify open doors to computer.


Each of these has ports 0 through 65536 (i.e., the range is from 2° to 216 for binary address calculation). The port numbers are divided into three ranges:

1.Well –known ports(from 0 to 1023)
2.Registered ports
3.Dynamic and /or private ports

```
20 FTP Data
21 FTP Control

22 SSH

25 SMTP

53 DNS

80 HTTP
```


Result of scan on port is usually categorized :
1. Open or accepted: The host has send the reply indicating that a service is listening on the port
2. Closed or not listening: The host sent a reply indicating that connections will be denied to the port.
3. Filtered or blocked: There was no reply from the host.


### Attack (to gain system access)

The scrutinizing phase is always called “enumeration” in the hacking world.

After the scanning and enumeration , the attack is launched using the following steps:
1.Crack the password
2.Exploit the privileges
3.Execute the malicious command/applications
4.Hide the files(if required)
5.Cover the tracks- delete the access logs, so that there is no trail illicit activity.


## Social Engineering Attacks

Social Engineering is the technique to influence and persuasion to deceive people to obtain the information or perform some action rather than exploiting computer security holes. People are seen as the weakest link in security making social engineering possible.

It is an art of exploiting the trust of people.

#### Human based Social engineering

Refers to person-to-person interaction to get the required /desired information .

1. Impersonating employee or valid user : 
2. Posing as an important user
3. Using a third person
4. Calling a technical support.
5. Shoulder surfing
6. Dumpster diving

#### Computer based social Engineering

Computer based social Engineering refers to an attempt made to get the required /desired information by using computer software/Internet.

1. Fake –Emails – Phishing
2. E-mail attachments- e.g.. Key logger utility to capture password. Virus, Trojans and worms can be included cleverly in to the attachments to entice a victim to open the attachment.
3. Pop-up windows- pop-up windows with special offers or free stuff can encourage user to unintentionally install malicious software.




## Attack Vector

Attack vector is a path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a computer or to a network server to deliver a payload or malicious outcome.

Attack vectors enable attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities including the human element.

Atack vectors include viruses , E-mail attachments webpages , pop-up windows, instant messages, chat rooms and deception, in which a human operator is fooled into removing or weakening system defenses.

## Attack Surface

An attack surface refers to the sum of all potential entry points where an
attacker could gain unauthorized access to a system, network, or data. It encompasses vulnerabilities, exposed services, and other entry points that a malicious actor could exploit.

A smaller attack surface means fewer points of vulnerability and less risk for an organization.

Physical, Digital and Social Engineering attack surfaces

#### Attack surface management (ASM)

Attack surface management (ASM) refers to processes and technologies that take a hacker‘s view and approach to an organization’s attack surface—discovering and continuously monitoring the assets and vulnerabilities that hackers see and attempt to exploit when targeting the organization. 

ASM typically involves:
* Continuous discovery, inventory, and monitoring of potentially vulnerable assets.
* Any ASM initiative begins with a complete and continuously updated inventory of an organization‘s internet-facing IT assets, including on-premises and cloud assets. 
* Taking a hacker’s approach ensures discovery not only of known assets, but also shadow IT applications or devices. 
* These applications or devices might have been abandoned but not deleted or deactivated (orphaned IT). Or assets that are planted by hackers or malware (rogue IT), and more—essentially any asset that can be exploited by a hacker or cyber threat.



## Cyberstalking

Cyberstalking is the use of the internet, email, social media, or other electronic communications to harass, threaten, or stalk an individual, group, or organization. Unlike general online harassment, cyberstalking is persistent, targeted, and often escalates over time, instilling fear or distress in the victim.

Attack Vectors used
* Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
* Email and messaging apps
* GPS tracking (via devices or apps)
* Public databases and doxxing websites
* Malware or spyware to track keystrokes or location
* Spoofing accounts to impersonate the victim

Attack Surface (data and devices vulnerable to attack)
* Personal devices: laptops, phones, tablets
* Online profiles: dating apps, forums, social media
* Publicly available information: job sites, phone directories
* Smart home devices with location tracking or audio/video feeds


## Botnet

Bot is an automated program for doing some particular task ,often over a network.

Botnet is a term used for collection of software robots, or Bots, that run
autonomously and automatically. Botnet term is often associated with malicious software but can also refer to the network of computers using distributed computing software.

Botnet (Zombie network) is a network of computers infected with a malicious program that allows cybercriminals to control the infected machine remotely without the user's knowledge.

One can gain access to a computer through malicious code and gain access to it can turn the computer into part of a Botnet even though it appears to be operating normally.

**Attack Vectors used to recruit new bots:**

* Phishing emails with malicious attachments or links
* Drive-by downloads from compromised or malicious websites
* Software vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers, or apps
* Malvertising (malicious ads)
* Infected USBs or cracked software

Once infected, the bot communicates with the Command and Control (C&C) server for instructions.

**Attack Surface :**
* Personal Computers, phones
* IoT devises (routers, smart TV's, webcams)
* Servers with weak credentials
* Cloud instances with exposed SSH or RDP
Modern botnets increasingly target IoT devices due to their weak security and always-on connectivity.


Botnets serve a variety of purposes, both for financial gain and disruption:
* Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
* Distributing spam
* Malware propagation (e.g., ransomware)
* Click fraud
* Credential stuffing attacks
* Mining cryptocurrencies (cryptojacking)
* Data theft and surveillance

DDos : Distributed Denial of service occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system making it unavailable for normal service.

#### Securing System 

1. Use antivirus and antispyware software and keep it up-to –date
2. Set the OS to download and install security patches automatically
3. Use a firewall to protect the system from hacking attacks while it is connected on the Internet
4. Disconnect the Internet while you are away from your computer.
5. Downloading the freeware only from the websites that are known and trustworthy
6. Check regularly the folders in mailbox- sent items- or outgoing for those messages you did not send.
7. Take immediate action if your system is infected.
