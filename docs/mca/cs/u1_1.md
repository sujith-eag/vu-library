**Cyber crime** refers to any illegal activity conducted using electronic devices and network, primarily targeting the computer systems, data and digital infrastructure.

It includes crimes committed using computers and the Internet, such as identity theft, financial fraud, data breaches, stalking victims, or disrupting operations through malicious programs.

Opportunities for cyber crime are rapidly increasing due to:

- The exponential growth of Internet connectivity
    
- Weaknesses in information security systems
    

## Common Types of Cyber Attacks

### 1. Techno-Crime

These are deliberate attacks on systems with the intent to:
- Copy or steal data
- Block access
- Corrupt or damage data or systems
    
### 2. Techno-Vandalism

Often random or opportunistic in nature, these include:
- Defacing websites
- Copying and publicizing sensitive files
- Other disruptive acts without clear motives

## Cyber Terrorism

**Cyber Warfare**
- State-sponsored cyber attacks targeting another nation's critical digital or military infrastructure
- These are Large-scale, coordinated operations with strategic objectives

**Cyber Terrorism**
- Conducted by non-state actors (e.g., terrorist groups or individuals)
- Aimed at creating fear, disrupting operations, or promoting political/religious agendas through digital means

## Recent Cyber Attack Trends in India

- **Phishing Attacks**: Deceptive emails/messages aimed at stealing sensitive information (e.g., fake RBI/KYC updates, UPI fraud links)
    
- **Digital Arrest Scam**: Criminals impersonate law enforcement officials to extort money via threats and fake video calls
    
- **UPI/BHIM Frauds**: Social engineering tactics used to gain unauthorized access to UPI apps or trick users into sending payments
    
- **SIM Swap Attacks**: Criminals obtain duplicate SIM cards to intercept OTPs and access bank accounts
    
- **Malware Attacks**: Malicious software spread via downloads, USB drives, or suspicious links to compromise systems
    
- **Ransomware Attacks**: Malicious software that encrypts a victim's data, rendering it inaccessible until a ransom is paid. These attacks often target critical sectors like healthcare and government.
    
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Spoofed or hacked email accounts used to deceive companies into transferring funds.
    
- **Website Defacement**: Government or public websites are defaced by hacktivists or terror groups to send a message or cause disruption
    
- **ATM Skimming**: Devices attached to ATMs to clone debit card data during transactions
    
- **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to large databases containing sensitive user or customer information
    

## Preventive Measures

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security to online accounts.
    
- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Avoid using easily guessable information.
    
- **Regularly Monitor Financial Statements**: Quick detection of unauthorized transactions can mitigate losses.
    
- **Be Cautious with Personal Information**: Avoid sharing sensitive details over the phone or online unless you're certain of the recipient's identity.
    
- **Educate Yourself and Others**: Awareness is key to recognizing and avoiding cyber threats.


## Information Security

Cyber security is the practice of protecting information, equipment, devices, computer resources, communication devices, and the information stored within them from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

It includes both the physical protection of devices and the security of the information contained in them.

### Issues Related to Data and Cyber Crimes

- Many organizations do not formally account for losses caused by computer-related incidents, unlike physical inventory losses such as shrinkage in retail.
    
- To avoid negative publicity, companies often avoid disclosing data on security breaches or cyber crimes, which hinders transparency and preparedness.
    

## Cybercriminals

Cybercriminals are individuals or groups who commit crimes using digital technologies. Common cyber crimes include:
*  Credit card fraud
* Cyberstalking
* Defaming another online, 
* Gaining unauthorized access to computer systems,
