A crime / illegal activity committed using a computer and the Internet to steal a person’s identity (Identity theft) or sell contraband or stalk victims or disrupt operations with, malevolent programs.

Cyber crime is any illegal behavior, directed by means of electronic operations, that targets the security of computer system and the data processed by them.


Opportunities for cyber crime exploitation are multiplying because of the exponential growth of Internet connection and weakness in information security.

Two Common types of attacks:
1. Techno crime : A predominant act against a system or systems with the intent to copy, steal , prevent access , corrupt or otherwise deface or damage parts

2. Techno-vandalism: These acts “brainless” defacement of websites and / or other activities such as copying files and publicizing their contents publicly , are usually opportunistic in nature.


### Cyber Terrorism :

Cyber warfare is typically state-level cyber attack, where nations attack each other's critical digital infrastructure or military for strategic gain. These are large scale and strategically coordinated attacks.


Cyber terrorism, is cyber attacks by non-state actors (terrorist groups, individuals) to create fear, disrupt operations, or achieve political or religious objectives.


### Current Cyber Attacks

* Phishing Attacks : Deceptive emails/messages to steal sensitive info like OTPs, passwords.( Fake RBI/KYC update messages; UPI fraud links)

* Digital Arrest Scam : Impersonation of law enforcement to extort money via threats and video calls.

* UPI/BHIM Fraud: Social engineering to gain access to UPI apps or request fake payments.

* SIM Swap Attacks : Criminals obtain duplicate SIM cards to intercept OTPs and access bank accounts.

* Malware Attacks : Malware infects devices through downloads, USB's or links

* Ransomware Attacks: Locking systems/data for ransom payments, often in cryptocurrency. (Government and Healthcare Sectors)

* Business Email Compromise (BEC) : Spoofed emails to trick companies into wiring money

* Website Defacement : Hacktivist or terror groups deface Indian gov websites

* ATM Skimming : Cloning debit card data via malicious devices attached to ATM's

* Data Breaches : Unauthorized access to large databases of users or customers. 




### Information Security

Cyber security means protecting information, equipment, devices, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification and destruction.

The term incorporates both the physical security of devices as well as the information therein.

#### Issue in data related to Cyber Crimes:

Organizations do not explicitly incorporate the cost of the vast majority of computer incidents into their accounting as opposed to, say accounting for the shrinkage of goods from retail stores.

In an attempt to avoid negative publicity most organizations abstain from revealing facts and figures about security incidents including cybercrime.

## Cybercriminals

Cyber criminals are those who perform cyber-crimes such as
*  Credit card fraud
* Cyberstalking
* Defaming another online, 
* Gaining unauthorized access to computer systems,
* Ignoring copyright, software licensing and trade mark protection, Overriding encryption to make illegal copies 
* Software piracy and stealing another’s identity. 

### Type of cybercriminals:

Type I: cyber criminals: hunger for recognition.
* Hobby hackers
* IT professionals (social engineering is one of the biggest threat)
* Politically motivated hackers.
* Terrorist organizations

Type II – Cybercriminals – not interested in recognition
* Psychological perverts
* Financially motivated hackers
* State-sponsored hacking (national espionage, sabotage)
* Organized criminals

Type III- Cybercriminals- the insiders.
* Disgruntled on former employees seeking revenge.
* Competing companies using employees to gain economic advantage through damage and/ or theft.

### Categories of Cybercrime

1. Crimes targeted at individuals: The goal is to exploit human weakness such as greed and naivety. 

2. Crimes targeted at property: This includes stealing devices. Transmitting harmful programs that can disrupt functions of the systems and/or can wipe out data from hard disk.

3. Crimes targeted at organizations: Cyberterrorism is one of the distinct crimes against organizations/governments. Attackers (individuals or groups of individuals) use computer tools and the Internet to usually terrorize the citizens of a particular country by stealing the private information, and also to damage the programs and files or plant programs to get control of the network and/or system.

4. Single event of cybercrime: It is the single event from the perspective of the victim. For example, unknowingly open an attachment that may contain virus that will infect the system (PC/laptop). This is known as hacking or fraud.

5. Series of events: This involves attacker interacting with the victims repetitively. For example, attacker interacts with the victim on the phone and/or via chat rooms to establish relationship first and then they exploit that relationship.

## Cyber Attacks

* **E-Mail spoofing** : A spoofed E-Mail is one that appears to originate from one source but actually has been sent from another source.

* **Spamming** : Spam is the abuse of electronic messaging systems (including most broadcast, media, digital delivery systems) to send unsolicited bulk messages indiscriminately.

* **Cyber Defamation** : when defamation takes place with help of computers and / or the Internet. Example: someone publishes defamatory matter about someone on a website or sends an E-mail containing defamatory information to all friends of that person. 

* **Salami attack** : These attacks are used for committing financial crimes. The idea is to make the alteration so insignificant that in a single case it would go completely unnoticed (Deducting minor amount from each person every month).

* **Data Diddling** : Data diddling attacks involves altering raw data just before it is processed by computer and then changing it back after processing is completed. 

* **Web Jacking** : Web jacking occurs when someone forcefully takes control of a website (by cracking the password and later changing it). The actual owner of the website does not have any more control over what appears on the website.

* **Web hijacking** : involve cloning legitimate websites, using lookalike domain names, or hijacking inactive web sessions. It is done for Traffic Re-direction, Credential Theft, Reputation Damage, Phishing, Spreading Malware.

* **Industrial Spying and Espionage** : “Spies” can get information about product finances , research and development and marketing strategies, an activity known as “industry spying”.

* **Hacking** : is the act of identifying and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system, network, or digital device to gain unauthorized access or control. Hackers may do this for malicious purposes, personal gain, curiosity, or even to improve security (in the case of ethical hackers).

* **Software Piracy** : theft of software through illegal copying of genuine programs or the counterfeiting and distribution of products intended to pass for the original.

* **Computer Sabotage** : The use of internet to hinder the normal functioning of a system through introduction of malware.

* **Password Sniffing** : Programs to monitor the name and password of network to compromise security.

* **Identity Theft** : Fraud involving another person's identity for an illicit purpose.

### Types of hacking

**Ethical Hacking** : Performed by security professionals to find and fix security flaws.

**Black Hat Hacking** : Malicious hacking for personal or financial gain.

**White Hat Hacking** : Legal and ethical hacking to improve system security.

**Grey Hat Hacking** : Hackers who may break laws but without malicious intent (e.g., to report bugs).

**Hacktivism** : Hacking for political or social causes (e.g., Anonymous group).

**Phishing** : Deceiving users to obtain sensitive info like passwords via fake emails/sites.

**Social Engineering** : Manipulating people into revealing confidential info (not always technical).

**Website Hacking** : Gaining unauthorized access to a website (e.g., through SQL injection).

**Network Hacking** : Exploiting vulnerabilities in a network to access data or systems.

**Malware Attacks** : Using viruses, worms, Trojans to gain unauthorized access or damage systems.

**Password Hacking** : Cracking or stealing passwords via brute force, dictionary attacks, etc.


### Malware, Virus and Worm

**Malware** : Short for malicious software, it's a general term for any software designed to harm, exploit, or disable computers,
systems, or networks (Virus, Worm, Trojan, spyware, Ransomware).

**Virus** : A type of malware that attaches itself to a host file or program and spreads when executed. It often requires
human action to activate. It can corrupt files or crash systems. ex: `ILOVEYOU virus`

**Worm** : A standalone type of malware that self-replicates and
spreads automatically across networks without user intervention. Can rapidly consume bandwidth and overload systems. ex: `WannaCry worm`




## Netizens

"Netizens" are the Internet users who spends considerable time online and also has considerable presence online (through websites about the person, through his/her active blog contribution and/or also his/her participation in the online chat rooms).

**5P Netizen mantra for online security:**

(a) Precaution, 
(b) Prevention, 
(c) Protection, 
(d) Preservation and 
(e) Perseverance.
