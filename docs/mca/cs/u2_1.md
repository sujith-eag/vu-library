## Attacks on Mobile Networks

The widespread use of mobile devices, public Wi-Fi, remote work, and connected technologies (e.g., smart mobility, automotive IoT) has significantly expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals. As a result, mobile networks are increasingly targeted by a variety of sophisticated attacks.

### Key Mobile Network Threats

1. **Malware, Viruses, and Worms**  
    Mobile devices are susceptible to malware that spreads via malicious apps, websites, or network connections. Malware can steal personal data, track user activity, or render devices unusable.
    
2. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS)**  
    Attackers flood mobile networks with excessive traffic, overloading infrastructure and denying legitimate users access to services.
    
3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**  
    Attackers intercept and possibly alter communication between two parties, especially over unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. This can lead to credential theft, session hijacking, or data manipulation.
    
4. **SIM Cloning**  
    The SIM card's identity is copied, allowing attackers to impersonate a user. This enables fraudulent calls, SMS, or data usage, and can also be used to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA).
    
5. **SMS Spoofing**  
    Fraudulent messages are sent to users, appearing to come from legitimate sources (e.g., banks, government). This is often used in phishing campaigns or to distribute malware.
    
6. **Baseband Attacks**  
    Exploit vulnerabilities in the baseband processor (which controls the phone’s communication functions). A successful baseband exploit can grant the attacker low-level control over the device without user interaction.
    
7. **Signaling System 7 (SS7) Attacks**  
    SS7 is the protocol used for signaling in mobile networks. Its weaknesses can be exploited to:    
    - Intercept calls or SMS
    - Track user location
    - Redirect communication without detection
        
8. **Rogue Base Station Attacks (Fake Cell Towers)**  
    Attackers set up unauthorized or malicious cell towers (e.g., IMSI catchers or Stingrays) to intercept, track, or manipulate mobile communications.
    
9. **Phishing and Smishing (SMS Phishing)**  
    Users are tricked into clicking malicious links or providing personal information through deceptive emails, messages, or SMS texts.
    
10. **Location Tracking and Spoofing**  
    Mobile network vulnerabilities can be exploited to:
	- Track a user’s real-time location
	- Feed false GPS/location data to mislead apps or services
    
11. **Mobile Spyware**  
    Apps embedded with spyware can record keystrokes, track location, or capture sensitive communications without user knowledge.
    
12. **Eavesdropping**  
    Passive monitoring of unencrypted voice or data transmissions, often performed via Wi-Fi sniffing or rogue base stations.
    
13. **Replay Attacks**  
    An attacker captures legitimate communication data (e.g., login requests) and retransmits it to gain unauthorized access.

## Credit Card Frauds

Credit card fraud involves unauthorized use of credit card information to make purchases or withdraw funds. Criminals employ both physical and online methods to commit these frauds.

### Modern Techniques Used in Credit Card Fraud

1. **Skimming**  
    Data from the magnetic strip or chip of a credit card is copied using a skimming device. The stolen data is then used to clone cards for fraudulent transactions.
    
2. **Phishing and Site Cloning**
    
    - Attackers create fake websites that closely resemble legitimate e-commerce or banking platforms.
        
    - Victims are tricked into entering their credit card and personal details.
        
    - This is typically achieved via fake emails or malicious links.
        
3. **Triangulation Fraud**
    
    - A fraudster sets up a fake e-commerce site offering popular items at low prices.
        
    - When a user places an order, the fraudster uses stolen credit card data (from previous victims) to buy and ship the item.
        
    - This fraud helps the criminal remain undetected while also collecting new user data.
        
4. **Credit Card Generators**
    
    - Criminals use software tools to generate valid-looking credit card numbers along with expiry dates.
        
    - These tools mimic the algorithm used by payment networks like Visa or Mastercard and are freely available online.
        
    - Although they can't validate the existence of a real account, they can sometimes bypass poorly secured systems.

### Tips to Prevent Credit Card Fraud

**Best Practices**:

- Use credit cards only on trusted and secure websites (HTTPS).
    
- Avoid saving card details on e-commerce sites or browsers.
    
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for financial accounts.
    
- Regularly monitor credit card statements and report suspicious activity immediately.
    
- Use virtual credit cards or masked card numbers for online purchases when possible.
    
- Set spending limits or transaction alerts through your bank.
    

**Things to Avoid**:

- Clicking links in unsolicited emails or SMS (phishing and smishing).
    
- Sharing card details via phone, email, or unencrypted platforms.
    
- Using public Wi-Fi for online shopping or financial transactions.
    
- Installing apps from unverified or third-party app stores.
