# Question 5

Modify the above program (4) to 
* include synchronization in a scenario where multiple threads are updating a shared list of integers. 
* Implement a `ThreadSafeList` class with synchronized methods to manage concurrent access. 
* Write a Java program that demonstrates how synchronization prevents data inconsistencies and race conditions when multiple threads add and remove elements from the list.


**1. `ThreadSafeList.java` (The class with synchronized methods)**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ThreadSafeList {
    private final List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

    // Synchronized method to add an element
    public synchronized void add(Integer element) {
        list.add(element);
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " added: " + element +
                           ". Current list: " + list.toString());
        // Simulate some processing time
        try {
            Thread.sleep(10);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupted status
            System.err.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " was interrupted during add.");
        }
    }

    // Synchronized method to remove an element (first occurrence)
    public synchronized boolean removeElement(Integer element) {
        boolean removed = list.remove(element);
        if (removed) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " removed: " + element +
                               ". Current list: " + list.toString());
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " tried to remove: " + element +
                               " (not found). Current list: " + list.toString());
        }
        try {
            Thread.sleep(15); // Simulate some processing time
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            System.err.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " was interrupted during remove.");
        }
        return removed;
    }

    // Synchronized method to remove element at a specific index
    public synchronized Integer removeAtIndex(int index) {
        if (index >= 0 && index < list.size()) {
            Integer removedElement = list.remove(index);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " removed at index " + index + ": " + removedElement +
                               ". Current list: " + list.toString());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(15);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                System.err.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " was interrupted during removeAtIndex.");
            }
            return removedElement;
        } else {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " tried to remove at index " + index +
                               " (out of bounds). Current list: " + list.toString());
            return null;
        }
    }


    // Synchronized method to get the list size
    public synchronized int size() {
        // System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " getting size: " + list.size());
        return list.size();
    }

    // Synchronized method to print the list (prevents ConcurrentModificationException)
    public synchronized void printList() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " printing list: " + new ArrayList<>(list)); // Print a copy
    }

    // For comparison: what happens without synchronization (DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION FOR SHARED LISTS)
    public void addUnsafe(Integer element) {
        list.add(element); // Potential race condition
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " (UNSAFE) added: " + element +
                           ". Current list size: " + list.size());
    }

    public boolean removeElementUnsafe(Integer element) {
        boolean removed = list.remove(element); // Potential race condition
        if (removed) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " (UNSAFE) removed: " + element +
                               ". Current list size: " + list.size());
        }
        return removed;
    }
}
```

**Explanation of `ThreadSafeList`:**

*   **`private final List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();`**: We encapsulate a standard `ArrayList`. It's `final` because the reference to the list object itself won't change, though its contents will.
*   **`synchronized` keyword**:
    *   When a method is declared `synchronized`, it means that only one thread can execute *any* synchronized method on a *particular instance* of `ThreadSafeList` at any given time.
    *   Java achieves this using an intrinsic lock (also called a monitor lock) associated with each object.
    *   When a thread calls a synchronized method, it attempts to acquire the lock for that object.
    *   If the lock is available, the thread acquires it, executes the method, and then releases the lock.
    *   If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread will block (wait) until the lock is released.
*   **`add()`, `removeElement()`, `removeAtIndex()`, `size()`, `printList()`**: All these methods access or modify the shared `list`. Making them `synchronized` ensures that these operations are atomic with respect to each other for a given `ThreadSafeList` instance. This prevents:
    *   **Race Conditions**: Where the outcome of the computation depends on the unpredictable timing of threads (e.g., two threads trying to add to the list simultaneously might corrupt its internal state if `ArrayList.add` itself isn't internally fully thread-safe for all combined operations).
    *   **Data Inconsistencies**: Such as one thread reading the size while another is halfway through adding an element.
    *   **`ConcurrentModificationException`**: If one thread tries to iterate or print the list while another thread is modifying it (e.g., adding or removing elements), this exception can occur with non-thread-safe collections. Synchronizing `printList` (or iterating within a synchronized block) prevents this.
*   `addUnsafe()` and `removeElementUnsafe()` are provided for conceptual comparison to show what *not* to do.

**2. `ListManipulator.java` (Runnable task to modify the list)**

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class ListManipulator implements Runnable {
    private final ThreadSafeList safeList;
    private final boolean isAdder; // True if this task adds, false if it removes
    private final int operations;
    private final Random random = new Random();

    public ListManipulator(ThreadSafeList safeList, boolean isAdder, int operations) {
        this.safeList = safeList;
        this.isAdder = isAdder;
        this.operations = operations;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < operations; i++) {
            if (isAdder) {
                int valueToAdd = random.nextInt(100); // Add random numbers 0-99
                safeList.add(valueToAdd);
            } else {
                // Try to remove from the start of the list if not empty
                if (safeList.size() > 0) {
                    safeList.removeAtIndex(0);
                } else {
                    // System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " found list empty, cannot remove.");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(5); // Wait a bit if list is empty before trying again
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                        break; // Exit loop if interrupted
                    }
                }
            }

            try {
                // Random sleep to make interleaving more apparent and less predictable
                Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(20) + 5);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Preserve interrupt status
                System.err.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " was interrupted in main loop.");
                break; // Exit loop if interrupted
            }
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished its operations.");
    }
}
```

**3. `SynchronizedDemo.java` (Main application)**

```java
public class SynchronizedDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("--- Main Thread Started ---");

        ThreadSafeList sharedList = new ThreadSafeList();
        int numOperationsPerThread = 10; // Each thread will perform this many add/remove operations

        // Create Adder Threads
        Thread adder1 = new Thread(new ListManipulator(sharedList, true, numOperationsPerThread), "Adder-1");
        Thread adder2 = new Thread(new ListManipulator(sharedList, true, numOperationsPerThread), "Adder-2");
        Thread adder3 = new Thread(new ListManipulator(sharedList, true, numOperationsPerThread), "Adder-3");


        // Create Remover Threads
        Thread remover1 = new Thread(new ListManipulator(sharedList, false, numOperationsPerThread), "Remover-1");
        Thread remover2 = new Thread(new ListManipulator(sharedList, false, numOperationsPerThread), "Remover-2");

        System.out.println("\nStarting threads to manipulate the synchronized list...");

        // Start all threads
        adder1.start();
        remover1.start(); // Mix start order
        adder2.start();
        remover2.start();
        adder3.start();


        // Wait for all threads to complete their work
        try {
            adder1.join();
            adder2.join();
            adder3.join();
            remover1.join();
            remover2.join();
            System.out.println("\nAll manipulator threads have completed.");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.err.println("Main thread interrupted while waiting: " + e.getMessage());
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Preserve interrupt status
        }

        System.out.println("\n--- Final State of the List ---");
        sharedList.printList();
        System.out.println("Final list size reported by main thread: " + sharedList.size());

        // For comparison - uncomment to see potential issues (may or may not throw an exception quickly)
        /*
        System.out.println("\n\n--- DEMONSTRATING UNSAFE ACCESS (EXPECT POTENTIAL ISSUES) ---");
        ThreadSafeList unsafeSharedList = new ThreadSafeList(); // Using the same class, but calling unsafe methods
        numOperationsPerThread = 500; // Increase operations to make issues more likely

        Thread unsafeAdder1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < numOperationsPerThread; i++) unsafeSharedList.addUnsafe(i);
        }, "UnsafeAdder-1");
        Thread unsafeAdder2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < numOperationsPerThread; i++) unsafeSharedList.addUnsafe(i + 1000);
        }, "UnsafeAdder-2");
        Thread unsafeRemover1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < numOperationsPerThread / 2; i++) unsafeSharedList.removeElementUnsafe(i);
        }, "UnsafeRemover-1");


        unsafeAdder1.start();
        unsafeAdder2.start();
        unsafeRemover1.start(); // May cause ConcurrentModificationException if other threads iterate


        try {
            unsafeAdder1.join();
            unsafeAdder2.join();
            unsafeRemover1.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Final UNSAFE list size: " + unsafeSharedList.list.size()); // Accessing internal list directly (bad practice)
        // You might see inconsistent sizes or ConcurrentModificationException if you try to iterate it here
        // while other threads are still (hypothetically) running or if the internal state is corrupt.
        */

        System.out.println("\n--- Main Thread Exiting ---");
    }
}
```

**How to Compile and Run:**

1.  Save the files: `ThreadSafeList.java`, `ListManipulator.java`, `SynchronizedDemo.java`.
2.  Compile:
    ```bash
    javac ThreadSafeList.java ListManipulator.java SynchronizedDemo.java
    ```
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    java SynchronizedDemo
    ```

**Output and Observations:**

*   You will see interleaved output from "Adder" and "Remover" threads.
*   Each line of output for an add or remove operation will show the thread name, the action, the element involved, and the state of the list *after* that operation.
*   Because the methods in `ThreadSafeList` are `synchronized`, you will not see partial updates or corrupted list states in the printouts from within those synchronized methods. For example, you won't see a size reported that doesn't match the elements listed if both `size()` and the list iteration for printing are synchronized.
*   The final list size should be `(3 * numOperationsPerThread) - (number of successful removals)`. Since removals only happen if the list is not empty, the number of successful removals might be less than `2 * numOperationsPerThread` if removers run too fast initially.
*   **Crucially, you should NOT get a `ConcurrentModificationException`** when the list is printed or its size is checked, because those operations are also synchronized, ensuring exclusive access.

**What if Synchronization Was Not Used?**

If you were to use a plain `ArrayList` directly from multiple threads without any synchronization (or call the `addUnsafe`/`removeElementUnsafe` methods in the example), you might encounter:

1.  **`ConcurrentModificationException`**: If one thread tries to iterate the list (e.g., for printing or in `list.toString()`) while another thread is adding or removing elements.
2.  **Incorrect Size**: `list.size()` might return an inconsistent value if a thread is in the middle of an add/remove operation.
3.  **Lost Updates/Corrupted Data**: The internal structure of the `ArrayList` could become corrupted (e.g., its internal array holding elements and its size counter get out of sync), leading to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or incorrect elements being retrieved.
4.  **Race Conditions**: The final state of the list could be unpredictable and vary from run to run.

The `synchronized` keyword provides a simple and effective way to ensure that only one thread can modify or access the critical sections (methods operating on the shared list) at a time, thus preventing these concurrency issues.
