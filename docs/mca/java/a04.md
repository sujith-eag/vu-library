# Question 4

Create two threads using the Thread class and Runnable interface. Explain the differences and demonstrate thread creation and management.


**1. Creating Threads**

**a) Using the `Thread` class (by extending it):**

```java
// MyThread.java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    private String threadName;
    private int count;

    public MyThread(String name, int count) {
        this.threadName = name;
        this.count = count;
        System.out.println("Creating " +  threadName );
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running " +  threadName );
        try {
            for(int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                System.out.println("Thread: " + threadName + ", Count: " + i);
                // Let the thread sleep for a short period to simulate work
                Thread.sleep(50);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " interrupted.");
        }
        System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " exiting.");
    }
}
```

**b) Using the `Runnable` interface (by implementing it):**

```java
// MyRunnable.java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    private String runnableName;
    private int count;
    private Thread thread; // Optional: to hold the thread object using this Runnable

    public MyRunnable(String name, int count) {
        this.runnableName = name;
        this.count = count;
        System.out.println("Creating Runnable: " +  runnableName );
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running task for: " +  runnableName );
        try {
            for(int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                // Thread.currentThread().getName() gives the actual thread's name
                System.out.println("Runnable Task: " + runnableName +
                                   " on Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName() +
                                   ", Count: " + i);
                Thread.sleep(70); // Slightly different sleep time for distinct output
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Runnable task " +  runnableName + " interrupted.");
        }
        System.out.println("Runnable task " +  runnableName + " finishing.");
    }

    // Optional method to create and start the thread associated with this Runnable
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting Thread for Runnable: " + runnableName);
        if (thread == null) {
            thread = new Thread(this, runnableName + "-Thread"); // Pass 'this' Runnable and a name for the Thread
            thread.start(); // This calls the run() method of this Runnable instance
        }
    }

    // Optional method to allow joining this runnable's thread
    public void join() throws InterruptedException {
        if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
            thread.join();
        }
    }
}
```

**2. Main Application to Demonstrate Threads**

```java
// ThreadDemo.java
public class ThreadDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("--- Main Thread Started ---");

        // --- Method 1: Using Thread Class ---
        System.out.println("\n--- Demonstrating extending Thread Class ---");
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread("Thread-A (Extends Thread)", 5);
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread("Thread-B (Extends Thread)", 3);

        // Starting the threads - this calls their run() method in a new execution path
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // --- Method 2: Using Runnable Interface ---
        System.out.println("\n--- Demonstrating implementing Runnable Interface ---");
        MyRunnable runnableTask1 = new MyRunnable("Runnable-X", 4);
        MyRunnable runnableTask2 = new MyRunnable("Runnable-Y", 6);

        // To run a Runnable, you need to create a Thread object and pass the Runnable instance to it.
        Thread threadForRunnable1 = new Thread(runnableTask1, "Thread-For-Runnable-X"); // Explicitly naming the thread
        Thread threadForRunnable2 = new Thread(runnableTask2); // Thread name will be auto-generated (e.g., "Thread-1")

        // Starting the threads that execute the Runnable tasks
        threadForRunnable1.start();
        threadForRunnable2.start();

        // Alternative way using the start() method within MyRunnable (if you added it)
        MyRunnable runnableTask3 = new MyRunnable("Runnable-Z (Self-Starting)", 3);
        runnableTask3.start(); // This encapsulates thread creation and starting

        // --- Thread Management: Waiting for threads to complete (join()) ---
        System.out.println("\nMain thread is now waiting for other threads to complete...");
        try {
            // Wait for thread1 (extends Thread) to complete
            thread1.join();
            System.out.println(thread1.getName() + " has finished.");

            // Wait for thread2 (extends Thread) to complete
            thread2.join();
            System.out.println(thread2.getName() + " has finished.");

            // Wait for threadForRunnable1 (executes Runnable) to complete
            threadForRunnable1.join();
            System.out.println(threadForRunnable1.getName() + " has finished.");

            // Wait for threadForRunnable2 (executes Runnable) to complete
            threadForRunnable2.join();
            System.out.println(threadForRunnable2.getName() + " has finished.");

            // Wait for runnableTask3's internally managed thread to complete
            runnableTask3.join(); // Using the join method we added to MyRunnable
            System.out.println("Runnable-Z-Thread has finished.");


        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.err.println("Main thread interrupted while waiting: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        System.out.println("\n--- All threads have completed. Main Thread Exiting ---");
    }
}
```

**3. Explanation of Differences and Thread Management**

**Differences between `extends Thread` and `implements Runnable`:**

| Feature                | `extends Thread`                                        | `implements Runnable`                                       |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inheritance**        | Your class *becomes* a `Thread`.                        | Your class defines a *task* that can be run by a `Thread`.  |
| **Multiple Inheritance**| Not possible if your class already needs to extend another class (Java doesn't support multiple class inheritance). | Possible. Your class can extend another class and still implement `Runnable` (and other interfaces). |
| **Object Type**        | The object is a specialized `Thread`.                   | The object is of your custom type, which is also a `Runnable`. A separate `Thread` object is needed to execute it. |
| **Code Organization**  | Tightly couples the task (code in `run()`) with the `Thread` object itself. | Promotes loose coupling. The task (`Runnable`) is separate from the execution mechanism (`Thread`). This is generally better for design. |
| **Resource Sharing**   | Less straightforward if multiple threads need to execute the *same instance* of a task with shared state (though possible). | Easier to share the same `Runnable` instance among multiple `Thread` objects, allowing them to operate on the same task logic and potentially shared data (requires careful synchronization). |
| **Flexibility**        | Less flexible.                                          | More flexible and generally the **preferred approach**.       |
| **Usage**              | Simpler for very basic scenarios where the class doesn't need to extend anything else. | Recommended for most use cases due to better design and flexibility. Used heavily in thread pools and Executor frameworks. |

**Why `implements Runnable` is generally preferred:**

1.  **Overcomes Single Inheritance Limitation:** If your class representing the task needs to extend another superclass, you can still make it runnable by implementing the `Runnable` interface.
2.  **Better Separation of Concerns:** The `Runnable` interface separates the *task* to be performed from the `Thread` *object that executes it*. This leads to cleaner, more modular design.
3.  **Resource Sharing:** A single `Runnable` object can be executed by multiple threads. This is useful if multiple threads need to perform the same operation, potentially on shared data (though synchronization then becomes crucial).
4.  **Compatibility with Executor Framework:** Java's `Executor` framework (e.g., `ThreadPoolExecutor`) works primarily with `Runnable` (and `Callable`) tasks, making it the more idiomatic choice for modern concurrent programming.

**Thread Creation and Management Demonstrated:**

1.  **Creation:**
    *   **`extends Thread`**: `MyThread thread1 = new MyThread(...)`;
    *   **`implements Runnable`**:
        *   `MyRunnable task = new MyRunnable(...)`;
        *   `Thread threadForTask = new Thread(task, "OptionalThreadName");`

2.  **Starting a Thread (`start()`):**
    *   `thread1.start();`
    *   `threadForTask.start();`
    *   **Important:** You **must** call `start()` to create a new thread of execution and invoke the `run()` method. If you call `run()` directly (e.g., `thread1.run()`), it will execute in the *current* thread, not a new one.

3.  **The `run()` Method:**
    *   This is where the actual logic of the thread goes. It's the entry point for the new thread.

4.  **Thread Naming:**
    *   Threads can be given names (e.g., `new Thread(runnable, "MyWorkerThread")` or `thread.setName("NewName")`). This is very useful for debugging. If not named, Java assigns a default name like "Thread-0", "Thread-1", etc.
    *   `Thread.currentThread().getName()` can be used inside `run()` to get the name of the currently executing thread.

5.  **Sleeping (`Thread.sleep(milliseconds)`):**
    *   `Thread.sleep(50);` pauses the current thread for the specified duration.
    *   It can throw an `InterruptedException`, which must be caught or declared. This exception is thrown if another thread interrupts the sleeping thread.

6.  **Waiting for a Thread to Die (`join()`):**
    *   `thread1.join();`
    *   When a thread calls `anotherThread.join()`, the calling thread (e.g., the `main` thread in our demo) will pause and wait until `anotherThread` completes its execution (i.e., its `run()` method finishes).
    *   This is crucial for scenarios where one thread's work depends on the completion of another.
    *   `join()` can also throw an `InterruptedException`.

7.  **Checking if Alive (`isAlive()`):**
    *   `thread.isAlive()` returns `true` if the thread has been started and has not yet died (completed its `run()` method). (Used in `MyRunnable.join()`).

**To Compile and Run:**

1.  Save the code into three files: `MyThread.java`, `MyRunnable.java`, and `ThreadDemo.java`.
2.  Compile:
    ```bash
    javac MyThread.java MyRunnable.java ThreadDemo.java
    ```
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    java ThreadDemo
    ```

You will see interleaved output from the different threads, demonstrating concurrent execution. The `join()` calls ensure that the "All threads have completed" message appears only after all worker threads have finished.
