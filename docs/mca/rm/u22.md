1. **Define Primary and Secondary Sources with Examples**
    
    - **Primary Sources**: Original materials or evidence directly related to a topic. Examples: research articles, theses, patents, lab data, interviews.
        
    - **Secondary Sources**: Interpretations or analyses based on primary sources. Examples: review articles, textbooks, commentaries.
        
2. **Define Different Types of Reviews in Literature Review**  
    Literature reviews can include:
    
    - Narrative or traditional reviews
        
    - Systematic reviews
        
    - Meta-analyses
        
    - Scoping reviews
        
    - Critical reviews
        
    - Integrative reviews
        
3. **Describe the Following Reviews with Their Description, Purpose, and Limitations**
    
    - **Narrative Review (Traditional Review)**:  
        _Description_: Summarizes the literature without a structured methodology.  
        _Purpose_: Broad overview of a topic.  
        _Limitations_: Subjective, prone to bias.
        
    - **Systematic Review**:  
        _Description_: Follows a structured, transparent method for identifying and analyzing studies.  
        _Purpose_: To minimize bias and provide high-quality evidence.  
        _Limitations_: Time-consuming, may exclude relevant studies due to strict criteria.
        
    - **Meta-Analysis**:  
        _Description_: Statistical technique combining results from multiple studies.  
        _Purpose_: To identify overall trends and effect sizes.  
        _Limitations_: Only applicable when quantitative data is available and studies are comparable.
        
    - **Scoping Review**:  
        _Description_: Maps the existing literature on a broad topic.  
        _Purpose_: Identify gaps, scope, and types of evidence.  
        _Limitations_: Less detailed assessment, not usually quality-focused.
        
    - **Critical Review**:  
        _Description_: Evaluates the quality and validity of existing literature.  
        _Purpose_: To challenge assumptions and explore theoretical frameworks.  
        _Limitations_: Subjective, requires expertise.
        
    - **Integrative Review**:  
        _Description_: Synthesizes data from theoretical and empirical literature.  
        _Purpose_: To create new perspectives or frameworks.  
        _Limitations_: Difficult to ensure consistency across different types of studies.
        
4. **What is a Monograph? Its Role and Need in Literature Review**  
    A **monograph** is a detailed written study on a single specialized subject or aspect of a subject.  
    _Role_: It provides deep insights and comprehensive background for scholarly research.  
    _Need_: Useful for developing in-depth understanding and context during a literature review.
    
5. **What is a Patent? Specify Its Role in Literature Review**  
    A **patent** is a legal document granting exclusive rights to an invention.  
    _Role_: Provides information on novel techniques and innovations.  
    _Use_: Helps identify technological trends, innovation gaps, and prior art.
    
6. **Why and How Are Patents Used in Literature Review?**
    
    - **Why**: To discover non-academic but valuable technical innovations.
        
    - **How**: By searching patent databases (e.g., Google Patents, USPTO) to identify existing inventions and avoid duplication of research.
        
7. **Define Different Research Databases in Literature Review with Pros and Cons**  
    Examples include:
    
    - **PubMed**  
        _Pros_: Biomedical focus, free access.  
        _Cons_: Limited outside health sciences.
        
    - **IEEE Xplore**  
        _Pros_: Excellent for engineering and technology.  
        _Cons_: Subscription-based.
        
    - **Scopus/Web of Science**  
        _Pros_: Broad coverage, citation tracking.  
        _Cons_: Expensive subscriptions.
        
    - **Google Scholar**  
        _Pros_: Free, broad coverage.  
        _Cons_: Lacks advanced filtering; includes non-peer-reviewed sources.
        
8. **What Are Web Sources in Literature Review? When Is It Appropriate to Use Them?**  
    Web sources include websites, blogs, forums, and news articles.  
    _Appropriate Use_: For up-to-date information, policy documents, government reports, and real-world data when peer-reviewed sources are lacking.
    
9. **How to Evaluate Web Sources? Give Example**  
    Evaluation criteria:
    
    - Authority (Who is the author/publisher?)
        
    - Accuracy (Is the information supported by evidence?)
        
    - Objectivity (Is it free from bias?)
        
    - Currency (Is it up to date?)
        
    - Coverage (Is the topic covered in depth?)
        
    
    _Example_: A government website (e.g., WHO.int) is considered credible for health-related data.
    
10. **What Is a Working Hypothesis? Its Role in Literature Review**  
    A **working hypothesis** is a provisional idea or assumption used as a starting point for further investigation.  
    _Role_: Helps guide the direction of the research based on gaps identified in the literature.
    
11. **Define Different Steps to Develop a Working Hypothesis in Literature Review with an Example**  
    Steps:
    
    - Conduct a comprehensive literature review.
        
    - Identify trends, contradictions, and gaps.
        
    - Formulate questions based on observed gaps.
        
    - Develop a hypothesis addressing the gap.
        
    
    _Example_:
    
    - Observation: Limited research on solar energy adoption in rural India.
        
    - Working hypothesis: "Lack of financial support is the primary barrier to solar energy adoption in rural Indian households."
        
12. **How to Identify Research Gaps from Literature Review and Literature Databases? Define the Steps**  
    Steps:
    
    - Review recent and relevant publications.
        
    - Note inconsistencies, unanswered questions, or limited coverage.
        
    - Analyze conclusions and future work sections of key papers.
        
    - Use research databases to check saturation or lack of studies in specific areas.
        
    - Synthesize findings to define a clear gap and potential area for further research.
