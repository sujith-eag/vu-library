A research design is the set of methods and procedures used in collecting and analyzing measures of the variables specified in the problem research.

A research design is a conceptual structure within which a research is conducted; it constitutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement and analysis of data.


### Parts of Research Design

(a) the sampling design which deals with the method of
selecting items to be observed for the given study;

(b) the observational design which relates to the conditions under which the observations are to be made;

(c) the statistical design which concerns with the question of how many items are to be observed and how the
information and data gathered are to be analysed; and

(d) the operational design which deals with the techniques by which the procedures specified in the sampling, statistical and observational designs can be carried out.


### Need for a research design

* It facilitates the smooth sailing of the various research operations.
* Makes research efficient by yielding maximal information.
* Minimizes expenditure of time, effort and money.
* Helps in advance planning of the methods to be adopted for collecting the relevant data and the techniques to be used in their analysis.


### Features of a good Research Design

* The nature of the problem to be studied
* The objectives of the problem to be studied
* The availability of time and money for the research work
* The means of obtaining information
* The availability and skills of the researcher and his staff

### İMPORTANT CONCEPTS RELATİNG TO RESEARCH DESİGN

1. Dependent and independent variables:
	A concept which can take on different quantitative values is called a variable. As such the concepts like weight, height, income are all examples of variables.


* If one variable depends upon or is a consequence of the other variable, it is termed as a dependent variable, and the variable that is prior to the dependent variable is termed as an independent variable.

* For instance, if we say that height depends upon age, then height is a dependent variable and age is an independent variable.


Continuous variables – phenomena which can take on quantitatively different values even in decimal points. For example, age.

Discontinuous or Discrete variables – If some variables can
be only expressed in integer values. For example, no. of children.


### IMPORTANT CONCEPTS RELATING TO RESEARCH DESIGN

Extraneous variable
• Independent variables that are not related to the purpose of the study, but may affect the dependent
variable are termed as extraneous variables.
• Whatever effect is noticed on dependent variable as a
result of extraneous variable(s) is technically
described as 'experimental error'.
• A study must always be so designed that the effect
upon the dependent variable is attributed entirely to
the independent variable(s), and not to some
extraneous variable or variables.

• Control - One important characteristic of a good
research design is to minimise the influence or effect
of extraneous variable(s). The technical term 'control'
is used when we design the study minimising the
effects of extraneous independent variables

• Confounded relationship - When the dependent
variable is not free from the influence of extraneous
variable(s), the relationship between the dependent
and independent variables is said to be confounded
by an extraneous variable(s).


• Research hypothesis - When a prediction or a hypothesised relationship is to be tested by scientific methods, it is termed as research hypothesis. The research hypothesis is a predictive statement that relates an independent variable to a dependent variable. Usually a research hypothesis must contain, at least, one independent and one dependent variable.



### IMPORTANT CONCEPTS RELATING TO RESEARCH DESIGN

。 Experimental and non-experimental hypothesis-
testing research
• When the purpose of the research is to test a research
hypothesis, it is termed as hypothesis-testing
research.
• It can be both of experimental design type or non- experimental design type.
• Research in which the independent variable(s) are
manipulated is termed as 'experimental hypothesis-
testing research' and a research in which they are not
manipulated is called 'non-experimental hypothesis-
testing research'.


IMPORTANT CONCEPTS RELATING TO RESEARCH DESIGN
。 Experimental and control groups
• In an experimental hypothesis-testing research when a
group is exposed to usual conditions, it is termed as
'control group', but when a group is exposed to some
novel or special condition, it is termed as 'experimental
group'.

。 Treatments
• The different conditions under which experimental and
control groups are put are usually referred to as
'treatments'.


。 Experiment
• The process of examining the truth of a statistical
hypothesis, relating to some research problem is known
as an experiment.
• For example, we can conduct an experiment to
examine the usefulness of a newly developed drug.
Experiments can be of two types viz., absolute
experiment and comparative experiment.
• Absolute experiment – Determining the impact of a
fertilizer on the yield of a crop.
• Comparative experiment – Determining the impact of
one fertilizer as compared to the impact of some other
fertilizer.



IMPORTANT CONCEPTS RELATING TO RESEARCH DESIGN

• Experimental unit(s)
• The pre-determined plots or blocks, where different
treatments are used, are known as experimental units.
• Such units must be selected (defined) very carefully.


DIFFERENT RESEAERCH DESIGN
1. Research design in case of Exploratory
Research
2. Research design in case of Descriptive and
Diagnostic research
3. Research design in case of Hypothesis -Testir
Research studies
Important
4. Research design in case of exploratory
research studies
■ The main purpose of such studies is that of formulating a problem for more precise investigation or of developing the working hypotheses from an operational point of view. The major objective of exploratory research can be-
✓ Evaluate the feasibility of a research project
✓ Formulate a research statement
✓ Provide theoretical basis for a hypothesis
✓ Establish priorities/ possibilities for further research.
■ Generally, the following three methods in the context of
research design for such studies are talked about:
▪ The survey of concerning literature;
▪ The experience survey and
▪ The analysis of 'insight-stimulating' examples.


In case of descriptive and diagnostic research
in case of descriptive research study –one those studied which are concerned with describing the characteristics of a particular Individual, or a group. In diagnostic research study determine the frequency which some thing occur
