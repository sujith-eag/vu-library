#### Qualitative Research
Qualitative research is a method of inquiry that seeks to understand human experiences, behaviors, and interactions by exploring them in-depth. It concerned with qualitative phenomenon.
Example : Investigating the reasons for human behavior.

### 4. Conceptual Vs Empirical

#### Conceptual Research :

It is related to some abstract idea or theory, and used to develop new concepts or to reinterpret existing one.

It involves research that is based on theorizing and synthesizing ideas and concepts without direct observation or experimentation.

It includes analytical and interpretative methods, including literature review, theoretical synthesis, and logical reasoning.

Example : Developing theories of philosophy, Mathematics and Economics
Formulating new economic or mathematical models based on existing data

#### Empirical Research :

It involves research that is based on direct observation, experimentation, and the collection of measurable evidence.Example : Investigating the reasons for human behavior.

It generates new, primary data through direct observations and experiments; relies on measurable and observable data.

Experimental methods, including controlled experiments, surveys, observations, and statistical analysis.

It involves active data collection, including using instruments and measurements to gather new data.

Example : Observing behavioral changes in response to a new educational method. Conducting clinical trials to test a new drug.
