>[!caution] Question
>Define Research problem. How to Formulate a Research Problem

A Research Problem is a question that a researcher wants to answer or a problem that a researcher wants to solve.

Formulating a Research Problem:
1. Selecting the problem
2. Necessity of defining the problem
3. Techniques involved in defining a problem

### 1. Selecting the Problem

* Subjects overdone are not chosen
* Controversial Subjects are not a choice
* Too narrow and too vague(uncertain subjects) should be avoided
* Subject should be familiar/feasible and related
* The importance of the subject, researcher qualification also plays vital role
* Cost and time are the major factors
* Follow Preliminary study


Characteristics of Good Topic
1. Interesting – keeps the researcher interested in it throughout the research process.
2. Researchable – can be investigated through the collection and analysis of data.
3. Significant – contributes to the improvement and understanding of educational theory and practice.
4. Manageable – fits the level of researcher’s level of research skills, needed resources, and time restrictions.
5. Ethical – does not embarrass or harm participants.

### 2. Necessity of Defining a Problem

A proper definition of research problem helps the researcher to be on the track. An ill-defined problem may create hurdles.

Some questions crop up in the mind of the researcher.
* What data are to be collected?
* What characteristics of data are relevant and need to be studied?
* What relations are to be explored?
* What techniques are to be used for the purpose?
* The answers of all these questions are possible only when the research problem has been well defined.
* Thus, defining a research problem properly is a step of the highest importance.

### 3. Technique Involved in Defining a Problem

Defining a research problem properly and clearly is a crucial part of a research study.
1. Statement of the problem in a general way
2. Understanding the nature of the problem
3. Surveying the available literature
4. Developing the ideas through discussions
5. Rephrasing the research problem into a working proposition

>[!caution] Question
>What do you mean by Pilot study. What are the different techniques to involved in research.

#### 3.1. Statement of the problem in a general way
* Keeping practical concern
* The researcher must immerse himself thoroughly in the subject matter concerning.
* In case of social research, the researcher has to do some field observation. He may undertake some sort of preliminary survey or known as pilot survey.

Pilot study - test, trial, experiment, trial run, dry run, experimental study, experimental investigation.

#### 3.2. Understanding the nature of the problem
For a better understanding of the nature of the problem involved, the researcher should
* Know its origin and nature clearly.
* Discuss with those who have a good knowledge of the problem concerned or similar other problems.
* Know about the environment within which the problem is to be studied and understood.

#### 3.3. Surveying the available literature
* The researcher must be surveyed the all available literature concerning the problem.
* Studies on related problems are useful for indicating the type of difficulties that may be encountered in the present study as also the possible analytical shortcomings.

#### 3.4. Developing the ideas through discussions
1. Discussion
2. Experience survey

#### 3.5. Rephrasing the research problem

Finally, the researcher must sit to rephrase the research problem into a working proposition.

Once the nature of the problem has been clearly understood, the environment has been defined, discussions over the problem have taken place and the available literature has been surveyed
and examined, rephrasing the problem into analytical or operational terms is not a difficult task.

Through rephrasing, the researcher puts the research problem in as specific terms as possible so that it may become operationally viable and may help in the development of working hypotheses

## Points to be observed while defining a Research Problem

* Technical terms and words or phrases, with special meanings used in the statement of the problem, should be clearly defined.

* Basic assumptions or postulates (if any) relating to the research problem should be clearly stated.

* A straight forward statement of the value of the investigation (i.e., the criteria for the selection of the problem) should be provided.• The suitability of the time-period and the sources of data available must also be considered by the researcher in defining the problem.

* The scope of the investigation or the limits within which the problem is to be studied must be mentioned explicitly in defining a research problem.
