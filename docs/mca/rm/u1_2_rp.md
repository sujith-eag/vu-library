# Research Process

Research process consists of series of actions or steps necessary to effectively carry out research.

The following are the various steps of research process.
1. Formulating the research problem.
2. Extensive literature survey.
3. Developing the hypothesis.
4. Preparing the research design.
5. Determining sample design.
6. Collecting the data.
7. Execution of the project.
8. Analysis of data.
9. Hypothesis testing.
10. Generalizations and interpretation.
11. Preparation of the report or presentation of the results, i.e., formal write-up of conclusions reached.


## 1. Formulating the research problem / Identify the Problem

The first step in the process is to identify a problem or develop a research question. A research problem identifies your destination. 

There are two types of research problems, viz., related to
i) states of nature and
ii) relationships between variables.

A researcher must decide the general area of interest or aspect of a subject-matter to study. This serves as the focus of the study.

Essentially two steps are involved in formulating the research problem, viz., understanding the problem thoroughly and rephrasing the same into
meaningful terms from an analytical point of view.

The best way of understanding the problem is to discuss it with one’s own colleagues or with some expertise in the matter.

The task of formulating, or defining, a research problem is a step of greatest importance in the entire research process.


## 2. Extensive literature survey/ Review the Literature

Once the problem has been identified, a brief summary (synopsis) of it should be prepared.

To do this, the researcher must review the literature related to the research problem.

This step provides foundational knowledge about the problem area

The review of literature also educates the researcher about what studies have been conducted in the past, how these studies were conducted, and the conclusions in the problem area

## 3. Development of working hypotheses

After extensive literature survey, researcher should state in clear terms the working hypothesis or hypotheses.

The role of the hypothesis is to guide the researcher by delimiting the area of research and to keep him on the right track.

It sharpens his thinking and focuses attention on the more important facets of the problem. 


The development of working hypotheses can be developed by using the following approach:

(a) Discussions with colleagues and experts about the problem, its origin and the objectives in seeking a solution;

(b) Examination of data and records, if available, concerning the problem for possible trends, peculiarities and other clues;

(c) Review of similar studies in the area or of the studies on similar problems; 

(d) Exploratory personal investigation which involves original field interviews on a limited scale with interested parties and individuals with a view to secure greater insight into the practical aspects of the problem.


## 4. Preparing the Research Design

The researcher is required to prepare a research design.

There are several research designs, such as, experimental and non-experimental hypothesis testing.

Experimental designs can be either informal designs or formal designs, out of which the researcher must select one for his own project.The preparation of the research design, appropriate for a particular research problem, involves usually the consideration of the following:
i. The means of obtaining the information;
ii. The availability and skills of the researcher and his staff (if any);
iii. Explanation of the way in which selected means of obtaining information will be organized
and the reasoning leading to the selection;
iv. The time available for research; and
v. The cost factor relating to research, i.e., the finance available for the purpose.

## 5. Determining sample design

The way of selecting a sample is popularly known as the sample design.

In other words, a sample design is a definite plan determined before any data are actually collected.

A brief mention of the important sample designs is as follows:
1. Deliberate sampling
2. Simple Random sampling
3. Systematic sampling
4. Stratified sampling
5. Quota sampling
6. Cluster sampling and area sampling
7. Multi-stage sampling
8. Sequential sampling

#### 1. Deliberate sampling
Deliberate sampling is also known as purposive or non-probability sampling.

Judgement sampling is used quite frequently in qualitative research where the desire happens to be to develop hypotheses rather than to generalize to larger population

#### 2. Simple random sampling

This type of sampling is also known as chance sampling or probability sampling.

In this each and every item in the population has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample.

EX.: if we have to select a sample of 300 items from a universe of 15,000 items, then we can put the names or numbers of all the 15,000 items on slips of paper and conduct a lottery.



#### 3. Systematic sampling

In some instances the most practical way of sampling is to select every 15th name on a list, every 10th house on one side of a street and so on.

Sampling of this type is known as systematic sampling.

#### 4. Stratified sampling

It is important that the sample includes representative groups of study units with specific characteristics.

Ex.: Residents from urban and rural areas.

The sampling frame must be divided into groups, or strata, according to these characteristics.

Random or systematic samples of a predetermined size will then have to be
obtained from each group (stratum). This is called stratified sampling.

#### 5. Quota sampling

The actual selection of items for the sample is left to the interviewer’s judgement. This is called quota sampling.

Quota sampling is an important form of non-probability sampling. Quota samples generally are judgement samples rather than random samples.

#### 6. Cluster sampling

Cluster sampling involves grouping the population. Then the groups or clusters are selecting rather than individual for inclusion
in the sample.

Ex.: Suppose a departmental store wishes to sample its credit card holders.

It has issued its cards to 15,000 customers.

The sample size is say 450. Among 15,000 customers, 100 clusters are formed.

Each cluster consists of 150 card holders. Three clusters are selected for the sample randomly


#### 7. Area Sampling

Under area sampling the total area is to be divided into a number of smaller nonoverlapping areas.

These are generally known as geographical clusters.

Then a number of these smaller areas are randomly selected.

All units in these small areas are included in the sample.


#### 8. Multi-stage sampling

Under multi-stage sampling the first stage may be to select large primary sampling units such as states, then districts, then towns and finally certain families within towns.

If the technique of random-sampling is applied at all stages, the sampling procedure is described as multi-stage random sampling.

#### 9. Sequential sampling

This design is usually adopted under acceptance sampling plan in the context of statistical quality control.

## 6. Collecting the data.

There are several ways of collecting the appropriate data.

They are differing considerably in context of money costs, time and other
resources of the researcher.

Primary data can be collected either through experiment or through survey.

The researcher conducts an experiment and observes some quantitative measurements or the data.

With the help of data the truth contained in the hypothesis can be examined.

1. By observation
2. Through personal interview
3. Through telephone interviews
4. By mailing of questionnaire
5. Through schedules(training)


## 7. Execution of the project.

Execution of the project is a very important step in the research process.
* The data to be collected would be adequate and dependable.
* The project should be executed in a systematic manner and in time.
* The data are to be collected through interviewers.
* The training may be given with the help of instruction manuals.
* Manuals explain clearly the job of the interviewers at each step.
* A careful watch should be kept for unanticipated factors in order to keep the survey as much realistic as possible.
* The steps should be taken to ensure that the survey is under statistical control So that the collected information is in accordance with the pre-defined standard of accuracy.
* If some of the respondents do not cooperate, then some suitable methods should be designed to tackle this problem.
* To deal with the non-response problem, make a list of the non-respondents and take a small sub-sample of them.
* Then with the help of experts vigorous efforts can be made for securing response.

## 8. Analysis of data

After the collection of data the next task is of analysis of the data.
The analysis of data requires a number of operations. Such as
* Establishment of categories, the application of these categories to raw data through coding, tabulation and then drawing.
* The unwieldy data should be converted into a few manageable groups and tables for further analysis.
* The raw data should be classified into some purposeful and usable categories. Coding operation is done at this stage. 
* Through this coding the categories of data are transformed into symbols
* Editing is the procedure that improves the quality of the data for coding. With coding the stage is ready for tabulation.
* Tabulation is a part of the technical procedure wherein the classified data are put in the form of tables.
* Analysis work is based on the computation of various percentages, coefficients, etc., by applying various well defined statistical formulae.
* In the process of analysis, relationships or differences supporting or conflicting with original or new hypotheses should be subjected to tests of significance to determine with what validity data can be said to indicate any conclusion(s).



## 9. Hypothesis testing.

After Analyzing the data the next step is the hypotheses test. Various tests, such as Chi square test, t-test, F-test, have been developed by statisticians for the purpose.
These test depending upon the nature and object of research inquiry.

Hypothesis-testing will result in either accepting the hypothesis or in rejecting it.


## 10. Generalizations and interpretation.

When hypothesis is tested several times, it is possible to arrive to build a theory.

The real value of research lies in its ability to arrive at certain generalizations.

When there is no hypothesis to start with, findings can be
explained on the basis of some theory.

It is known as interpretation. The process of interpretation will trigger off new questions. In turn it may lead to further researches

## 11. Preparation of the report or thesis

The layout of the report should be as follows:
* the preliminary pages;
* the main text, and
* the end matter.
* The preliminary pages the report should carry title and date followed by acknowledgements and foreword.
* Then there should be a table of contents followed by a list of tables and list of graphs and charts, if any, given in the report.


The main text of the report should have the following parts:
* Introduction
* Summary of findings
* Main report
* Conclusions
