#### Queues: Introduction to Queues, Definition, Array Representation of Queues, Primitive operations of queue and its implementation; 

* What is Queue? List its types. Mention the limitations of Linear Queue. Also Explain the insert, delete and display operations on Queue with appropriate examples.

* Write a C program to simulate the insert and delete operations of a Queue. Trace the program for the following sequence of operations for Queue of size 3. i. Insert 3 elements ii. Delete 2 elements iii. Insert 3 elements.

**Answer :**

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the element that is inserted first is the one to be removed first. 
- Front: The front of the queue represents the position from where elements are removed.
- Rear: The rear of the queue represents the position where elements are added.

It can be visualized like a line of people standing at a counter; the person who arrives first is served first.

**Types of Queues:**
1. **Linear Queue**: A simple queue where elements are inserted at the rear end and removed from the front end.
2. **Circular Queue**: A queue where the last position is connected back to the first position, making it circular. It solves the problem of the wasted space in a linear queue.
3. **Priority Queue**: In this queue, elements are assigned priorities, and elements with higher priority are dequeued first.
4. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**: A queue where insertion and deletion can be done from both ends, i.e., both front and rear.

**Limitations of Linear Queue:**
1. **Fixed Size**: A linear queue has a fixed size, and once it is full, no more elements can be added, even if there is space in the middle of the queue after elements have been removed.
2. **Wasted Space**: In a linear queue, once elements are dequeued, the spaces occupied by them cannot be reused unless we rearrange the elements.

**Queue Operations:**
1. **Insert (Enqueue)**: To add an element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Delete (Dequeue)**: To remove an element from the front of the queue.
3. **Display**: To display all the elements in the queue.
4. IsEmpty and IsFull : to check empty and full queue

#### Applications of Queue

* Ticket Booking Systems:Managing people in a queue for seat allotments.
* Call Center Support:Customer calls handled in the order they are received.
* Printers:Print jobs are executed sequentially in the order of request.
* Messaging Systems:Managing message delivery in applications like SMS.
* CPU Task Scheduling:Processes waiting to be executed by the CPU.
* Networking:Packets waiting to be transmitted in routers.
* Order Processing:Online shopping orders being processed sequentially.
* Traffic Light Systems:Vehicles passing through intersections in a queued manner.
* Task Queues in Applications :Background jobs like email sending or notifications.

#### Types of Queues: How to overcome the drawbacks of Linear Queue using Circular Queue, Representation of Circular Queues, Deques and Priority Queues.

* Identify the limitations of linear queue? How can it be resolved by the circular queue?
* Explain the limitations of Linear Queue with an example. Also explain with the program how to overcome these limitations using Circular Queue.
* State the limitations of Linear Queue and explain how it will be resolved in Circular Queue. Explain the algorithms for Insertion and Deletion of elements in a circular queue.
* Write a program to perform insert and delete operations on Circular QUEUE.

**Answer :**

A Linear Queue is a basic queue where the elements are added at the rear and removed from the front. However, it has some significant limitations:

**Fixed Size**:  Linear queues often have a fixed size declared in the beginning, meaning if the queue becomes full, no more elements can be inserted by adjusting the size dynamically.

**Wasted Space (Underutilization)**: In a linear queue, once the front of the queue moves forward after several `dequeue` operations, the space occupied by those elements cannot be reused. This causes wasted space, even if there is space available at the rear.

Suppose the queue has a size of 5 and the elements `10, 20, 30, 40, 50` are inserted and remove `10, 20`), the queue will look like:
```
Front -> 30, 40, 50 <- Rear
```
The space freed up by the `10` and `20` can't be reused, and thus, the queue will be "full" despite having free space at the front.

____

Circular Queue solves these limitations by circularly connecting the end of the queue to the front, for better utilization of space. In a circular queue, when the rear reaches the end of the array, it can wrap around to the beginning of the queue if space is available.

When elements are dequeued, the front pointer moves ahead, and the space at the front can be reused for enqueue operations as the rear moves into that space circularly when elements are added.

1. Enqueue `10, 20, 30, 40, 50`
2. Dequeue `10, 20`
3. Enqueue `60` — _Works because the space freed by `10` and `20` is reused._

```
Front -> 30, 40, 50, 60 <- Rear (after two dequeues)
```

---

Insertion (Enqueue) Algorithm in Circular Queue:
* Checking if the queue is full: Queue is full if the next position of the rear pointer is equal to the front pointer.  
* `front == (rear + 1) % max_size`

* Insert the element:  If the queue is not full, increment the `rear` pointer (circularly) and insert the element at the rear by Adjusting the pointer circularly using modulus.
* `rear = (rear + 1) % max_size`,   where `max_size` is the maximum size of the queue.

Deletion (Dequeue) Algorithm in Circular Queue:
* Check if the queue is empty:  The queue is empty if `front == -1`.
* Check if `front == rear` which means there is only one element, then rear and front are set to `-1` to show queue is empty.

- If the queue is not empty, remove the element at the front, and increment the `front` pointer (circularly).
- `front = (front + 1) % max_size`.

int queue[MAX];
int front = -1, rear = -1;

// Function to insert an element into the queue (enqueue)
void enqueue(int value) 
{
    if ( front == (rear + 1) % MAX) 
    {
        printf("Queue is full! Cannot insert %d\n", value);
    } 
    else 
    {
        if (front == -1) 
        {  // If the queue is empty
            front = 0;
        }
        rear = (rear + 1) % MAX;  // Circular increment of rear
        queue[rear] = value;

##### What do you mean by priority queue? Discuss different types of priority queue.

**Answer :**

Priority Queue is a data structure that operates similarly to a regular queue but each element in the priority queue is associated with a priority. The element with the highest priority is always served before the elements with lower priority, regardless of their insertion order. 

The order of elements depends on their priority levels so elements with high priority are dequeud first. If two elements have the same priority, they are dequeued according to their insertion order.

Priority queues are typically implemented using data structures that allow efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority:

#### Memory Allocation


Memory allocation refers to the process of assigning memory space to variables or data structures during the execution of a program. In programming, especially in languages like C and C++, memory can be allocated in two ways: **static** and **dynamic**.

---

#### Static Memory Allocation

Static memory allocation is the process where memory is allocated at **compile time**. Once memory is allocated, it remains fixed throughout the execution of the program and cannot be changed or altered during runtime.

- The memory is allocated from the **stack**.

- It is generally **faster** and involves **less overhead** since the memory is reserved in advance.

- Since the size is fixed, it may lead to **memory wastage** if the allocated size is more than required, or **overflow** if it's less than required.

```c
int a[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
// Array of fixed size 5
```

Here, memory for 5 integers is allocated during compilation and cannot be resized during execution.

---

#### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation is done at **runtime**, allowing the program to request memory as needed during execution. This provides flexibility as the memory size can be adjusted according to the requirements of the program.

- Memory is allocated from the **heap**.

- It is **more efficient** in terms of memory usage because only the required amount of memory is allocated.

- However, it requires **manual memory management** to avoid memory leaks.

---

#### Functions Used for Dynamic Memory Allocation in C

* `malloc()` – Memory Allocation  

Allocates a single block of memory of a specified size but does **not initialize** it. The memory contains **garbage values** by default.

```c
ptr = (type*) malloc(size_in_bytes);
```

```c
int* arr = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
```

____

* `calloc()` – Contiguous Allocation  

Similar to `malloc()`, but allocates **multiple blocks** of memory and **initializes each block to zero**.

```c
ptr = (type*) calloc(number_of_elements, size_of_each_element);
```

```c
int* arr = (int*) calloc(5, sizeof(int));
```

____

* *`realloc()` – Reallocation of Memory

Used to **resize** a previously allocated memory block. Useful when the originally allocated memory is insufficient.

```c
ptr = realloc(ptr, new_size_in_bytes);
```

```c
arr = realloc(arr, 10 * sizeof(int)); 
// Resize array to hold 10 integers
```

____

* `free()` – Memory Deallocation  

Frees the dynamically allocated memory, returning it to the heap to avoid **memory leaks**.

```c
free(ptr);
```

### Linked list: Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, called nodes, where each node is stored separately in memory and connected via pointers.

Each node in a **singly linked list** contains two parts:

1. Data – stores the actual value.
2. Pointer (Next) – stores the reference to the next node in the sequence.

An extra pointer, usually called **head**, is used to keep track of the beginning of the list. Optionally, a **tail** pointer may be used to point to the last node for faster insertions at the end.

---

- **No Direct Access**: Elements cannot be accessed directly using an index.

- **Extra Memory Overhead**: Each node requires extra memory for storing a pointer.

- **Slower Search Time**: Searching is O(n) because you must traverse the list node by node.

---

#### Doubly Linked List vs. Singly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains three parts:
1. Data
2. Pointer to the next node
3. Pointer to the previous node

This allows traversal in **both directions** — forward and backward.

1. Bidirectional Traversal:
    - In a singly linked list, you can only traverse in one direction (forward).
    - In a doubly linked list, you can traverse both forward and backward using the `next` and `prev` pointers.
        
2. Easier Deletion of a Given Node:
    - In a singly linked list, to delete a node, you must keep track of the previous node.
    - In a doubly linked list, the node itself holds a pointer to its previous node, making deletion straightforward without needing to traverse back.

3. Efficient Insertion and Deletion at Both Ends:
    - With a doubly linked list (and with a tail pointer), insertion and deletion at both the beginning and end of the list can be done efficiently in O(1) time.

4. More Flexible Navigation:    
    - Can implement reverse traversal or reverse printing easily.
    - Useful in applications like undo/redo operations, where you need to move back and forth in history.

5. Better for Certain Complex Data Structures:    
    - Doubly linked lists serve as a base for more complex structures like **doubly-ended queues (deque)** and **linked hash maps**.

---

#### Representation and implementation of operations (Insertion, Deletion and Search) of Singly linked list

* Write an algorithm to insert a node in between any two nodes in an ordered linked list.
* Write a C Program to insert a node with a value X to the right of the node with the value Y in a SLL.
* Develop routines to perform each of the following operation on a linear list: i. Delete every second element for a list    ii. Return the number of elements in the list.
* Write an algorithm to search an item in a singly linked list. Explain the algorithm with example.

____

* Design a program to create Singly Linked List (SLL) of student data having the following the fields: Std_USN, Name, Marks and Total and display the same.

* Illustrate the creation and display operations on Singly Linked List (SLL) of Employee Data with the fields: Employee ID, Name, company name and Mobile number.

* Implement a singly linked list to store a polynomial equation.

_____

### Operations on Doubly and Circular Linked Lists,

* Examine the advantages of double linked list over single linked list.
* Write a C function to insert a node in a doubly linked list by position. Your program should take position as input from the user.
* Differentiate between doubly Linked List and singly Linked List. Write a C function to insert a node in a doubly linked list by position. Your program should take position as input from user.
* Differentiate between doubly Linked List and singly Linked List. Also develop a ‘C’ routine to insert a node before a given key node in a doubly linked list.
