# Relational Model Concepts

The **relational model** represents the database as a collection of **relations**, where each relation resembles a **table of values** or a **flat file** of records.

> It is called a _flat file_ because each record has a simple, linear (flat) structure.

When a relation is viewed as a table:

- Each **row** represents a collection of related data values.
    
- A row typically corresponds to a real-world **entity** or **relationship**.
    
## Components of the Relational Model

- A **row** is called a **tuple**. It holds a unique data set.  
    (**Cardinality**: Total number of rows in a relation.)
    
- A **column header** is called an **attribute**. It defines the properties or characteristics of the data.  
    (**Degree**: Total number of columns in a relation.)
    
- A **domain** defines the set of valid values and the data type allowed for an attribute.
    
- A **relation** refers to the entire table structure made up of tuples and attributes.

### Domain

A **domain (D)** is a set of **atomic values**.

- **Atomic** means each value in the domain is **indivisible** from the perspective of the relational model.
    
- Each domain has a specified **data type or format** (e.g., integer, string, date).
    
---

### Properties of a Valid Relation

1. Each relation (table) has a unique name.
    
2. Attribute values are atomic (indivisible).
    
3. Attribute (column) names are unique within a relation.
    
4. No duplicate tuples (rows) are allowed.
    
5. The order of rows and columns is not significant.
    
6. Integrity constraints must be followed to maintain data consistency.

### Relation Schema

A **relation schema (R)** is denoted as:

**R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)**

Where:

- **R** is the name of the relation.
    
- **A1, A2, ..., An** are the attributes of the relation.
    
- Each attribute **Ai** is associated with a domain **D**, denoted as **dom(Ai)**, which defines the set of valid values it can hold.
    
- The **degree** or **arity** of a relation is the number of attributes **n** in the schema.
    
---

### Relation Instance

A **relation instance (r)** of the schema **R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)** is denoted as:

**r(R) = {t1, t2, t3, ..., tm}**

Where:

- Each **t** is an **n-tuple**, an ordered list of **n values**:  
    **t = ⟨v1, v2, v3, ..., vn⟩**
    
- Each value **vi** (1 ≤ i ≤ n) is either:
    
    - From the domain **dom(Ai)**, or
        
    - A special **NULL** value, representing unknown or inapplicable data.
        
---

### Characteristics of Relations

1. **Ordering of Tuples**
    
    - Tuples (rows) in a relation are **not ordered**.
        
    - The order of tuples does **not affect** the relation.
        
2. **Ordering of Values within a Tuple**
    
    - Although the tuples themselves are unordered, the **position of each value in a tuple matters**, as it corresponds to a specific attribute.
        
    - This ordering defines the structure of the data in the tuple.
        
3. **Values and NULLs in Tuples**
    
    - Each value in a tuple must be:
        
        - **Atomic**: Indivisible within the relational model.
            
        - From the attribute's domain or **NULL**.
            
    - Composite and multivalued attributes are **not allowed** in the basic relational model.
        
    - **NULL** is a special marker used to indicate: Unknown values, Inapplicable values.
            
    - NULLs do **not** imply zero or empty string—they are distinct.

### Relational Model Notation

The following notation is commonly used:

1. A **relation schema R** of degree **n** is denoted by:  
    **R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)**
    
2. Uppercase letters **Q, R, S** denote **relation names**.
    
3. Lowercase letters **q, r, s** denote **relation states** (instances of relations).
    
4. Letters **t, u, v** denote **tuples**.
    
5. The **name of a relation schema** (e.g., `STUDENT`) also refers to the **current set of tuples** (state) in that relation.
    
6. An **attribute A** belonging to a relation **R** can be **qualified** using dot notation:  **R.A**. For example, STUDENT.Name or STUDENT.Age. This is because the same name may be used for two attributes in different relations. However, all attribute names in a particular relation must be distinct.
    
7. An **n-tuple t** in a relation instance **r(R)** is denoted as:  
    **t = ⟨v1, v2, ..., vn⟩**,   where each **vi** corresponds to the value of attribute **Ai**.
    
8. Tuples can also be denoted using **named attributes**:
	Example:  
	`t[Name] = ⟨'Barbara Benson'⟩`  
	`t[Ssn, Gpa, Age] = ⟨'533-69-1238', 3.25, 19⟩`

## Relational Keys

Keys are used to uniquely identify records in a relation and enforce relationships between tables.

1. **Super Key (SK)**
    
    - Any combination of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a record (tuple) in a relation.
        
2. **Candidate Key (CK)**
    
    - A _minimal super key_—no unnecessary attributes.
        
    - Must be unique and contain no null values.
        
3. **Primary Key (PK)**
    
    - One of the candidate keys selected to uniquely identify records in the table.
        
    - Chosen for simplicity (typically the one with the least number of attributes).
        
    - Cannot contain null values.
        
4. **Alternate Key (AK)**
    
    - Candidate keys not chosen as the primary key.
        
    - Still unique and non-null.
        
5. **Foreign Key (FK)**
    
    - An attribute (or set of attributes) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
        
    - Enables cross-table referencing.
        
    - Example: `cust_id` in the Orders table referencing `id` in the Customer table.
        
6. **Composite Key**
    
    - A primary key that consists of **two or more attributes**.
        
7. **Compound Key**
    
    - A composite key that also includes **two foreign keys**, used to link two different tables together.
        
8. **Surrogate Key**
    
    - A system-generated or artificial key (e.g., auto-incremented integer) used as the primary key.
        
    - Has no business meaning and is often used for simplicity and performance.
