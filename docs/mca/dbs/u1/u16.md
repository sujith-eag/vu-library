# Relational Model Concepts

The **relational model** represents the database as a collection of **relations**. Informally, each relation resembles a **table of values** or, to some extent, a **flat file** of records. It is called a flat file because each record has a simple linear or flat structure.

When a relation is thought of as a table of values:

- Each **row** represents a collection of related data values.
    
- A row typically corresponds to a real-world **entity** or **relationship**.
    

In formal relational model terminology:

- A **row** is called a **tuple**.
    
- A **column header** is called an **attribute**.
    
- The **table** is called a **relation**.
    
- The data type that defines the set of values for a column is called a **domain**.

### Domain

A **domain (D)** is a set of **atomic values**.

- **Atomic** means each value in the domain is **indivisible** as far as the relational model is concerned.
    
- A **datatype or format** is specified for each domain.

### Relation Schema

A **relation schema (R)** is denoted by:  
**R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)**

Where:

- **R** is the name of the relation.
    
- **A1, A2, ..., An** are the attributes.
    
- Each attribute **Ai** is associated with a domain **D**, denoted as **dom(Ai)**.
    
- The **degree** or **arity** of a relation is the number of attributes **n** in the schema.
    

---

### Relation Instance

A **relation instance (r)** of the schema **R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)** — denoted as **r(R)** — is a set of **n-tuples**:

**r = {t1, t2, t3, ..., tm}**

Each **n-tuple t** is an ordered list of **n values**:  
**t = ⟨v1, v2, v3, ..., vn⟩**

Where:

- Each **vi** (1 ≤ i ≤ n) is a value from **dom(Ai)** or a special **NULL** value.
    
## Characteristics of Relations

1. **Ordering of tuples** in a relation:  
    Tuples are not ordered in a relation. The order in which tuples appear is not significant.
    
2. **Ordering of values within a tuple:**  
    Although tuples are unordered in a set, the position of values within a tuple matters, as it corresponds to attributes.
    
3. **Values and NULLs in tuples:**  
    Each value in a tuple is from the domain of its attribute or can be **NULL**, representing unknown or inapplicable values.
    

## Relational Model Notation

The following notation is commonly used:

1. A **relation schema R** of degree **n** is denoted by:  
    **R(A1, A2, A3, ..., An)**
    
2. Uppercase letters **Q, R, S** denote **relation names**.
    
3. Lowercase letters **q, r, s** denote **relation states** (instances of relations).
    
4. Letters **t, u, v** denote **tuples**.
    
5. The **name of a relation schema** (e.g., `STUDENT`) also refers to the **current set of tuples** (state) in that relation.
    
6. An **attribute A** belonging to a relation **R** can be **qualified** using dot notation:  
    **R.A**
    
7. An **n-tuple t** in a relation instance **r(R)** is denoted as:  
    **t = ⟨v1, v2, ..., vn⟩**,  
    where each **vi** corresponds to the value of attribute **Ai**.
    
8. Tuples can also be denoted using **named attributes**:
    
    - Example:  
        **t[Name] = ⟨'Barbara Benson'⟩**  
        **t[Ssn, Gpa, Age] = ⟨'533-69-1238', 3.25, 19⟩**
        

# Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas

The state of the whole database corresponds to the states of all its relations at a particular point in time. There are generally many restrictions or constraints on the actual values in a database state. Constraints on databases can generally be divided into four main categories:

1. **Inherent model-based constraints (implicit constraints):** Constraints that are inherent in the data model.
    
2. **Schema-based constraints (explicit constraints):** Constraints that can be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model, typically by specifying them in the DDL.
    
3. **Application-based or semantic constraints (business rules):** Constraints that cannot be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model and must be enforced by application programs or other means.
    
4. **Data dependencies:** Constraints that are functional dependencies or multivalued dependencies.
    
## Domain Constraints

A domain constraint specifies that within each tuple, the value of each attribute **A** must be an atomic value from the domain **dom(A)**.

## Key Constraints and Constraints on NULL Values

A relation is defined as a set of tuples. All tuples in a relation must be distinct, meaning that no two tuples can have the same combination of values for all attributes.

- A **superkey (SK)** specifies a uniqueness constraint such that no two distinct tuples in any state of relation **R** can have the same value for **SK**.
    
- Every relation has at least one default superkey — the set of all its attributes.
    
- A **key (K)** of a relation schema **R** is a superkey with the additional property that removing any attribute **A** from **K** results in a set of attributes that is no longer a superkey.
    

A key satisfies two properties:

1. **Uniqueness:** Two distinct tuples in any state of the relation cannot have identical values for all attributes in the key. This also applies to a superkey.
    
2. **Minimality:** A key is a minimal superkey; no attributes can be removed while still preserving uniqueness.
    

A relation schema may have more than one key. In this case, each is called a **candidate key**. One of them is usually designated as the **primary key**, typically underlined when specifying the relation.

- A **superkey** is any set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.
    
- A **candidate key** is a minimal superkey.


## Relational Databases and Relational Database Schemas

A **relational database schema (S)** is a set of relation schemas:  
**S = {R1, R2, R3, ..., Rm}**  
and a set of integrity constraints **IC**.

A **relational database state (DB)** of **S** is a set of relation states:  
**DB = {r1, r2, ..., rm}**  
such that each **ri** is a state of **Ri** and satisfies the integrity constraints specified in **IC**.

- A database state that **does not satisfy all constraints** is called **not valid**.
    
- A database state that **does satisfy all constraints** is called a **valid state**.
    
Integrity constraints are defined on the database schema and must hold on every valid state.

## Entity Integrity, Referential Integrity, and Foreign Keys

### Entity Integrity

- No **primary key** value can be **NULL**.
    
### Referential Integrity

A referential integrity constraint is specified between two relations to maintain consistency among tuples.

A set of attributes **FK** in relation schema **R1** is a **foreign key** referencing relation **R2** if:

1. The attributes in **FK** have the same domain(s) as the primary key attributes **PK** of **R2**.
    
2. For any tuple **t1** in the current state of **R1**, the value of **FK** either:
    
    - Occurs as the value of **PK** in some tuple **t2** in **R2**, or
        
    - Is **NULL**.
        
- **R1** is called the referencing relation.
    
- **R2** is the referenced relation.
    
- A foreign key can refer to the same relation it belongs to (self-referencing).
    

## Other Types of Constraints

- **Semantic integrity constraints:** e.g., the salary of an employee should never be more than their supervisor’s. Enforced using triggers or assertions.
    
- **State constraints:** The database state must always be valid.
    
- **Transition constraints:** e.g., the salary of an employee can only increase.

# Update Operations, Transactions, and Dealing with Constraint Violations

### Operations of the Relational Model:

- **Retrievals:** Queries that return new relations by applying relational operators.
    
- **Updates:** Modify the state of relations using:
    
    - **Insert:** Adds new tuples.
        
    - **Delete:** Removes existing tuples.
        
    - **Update (Modify):** Changes attribute values in existing tuples.
        

All operations must respect integrity constraints.


## The Insert Operation

Provides attribute values for a new tuple **t** in relation **R**. Insert can violate:

- **Domain constraint:** If an attribute value does not match its domain.
    
- **Key constraint:** If the key value already exists.
    
- **Entity integrity:** If a primary key value is **NULL**.
    
- **Referential integrity:** If a foreign key value refers to a non-existent tuple.
    

## The Delete Operation

Can violate **referential integrity** if the deleted tuple is referenced by foreign keys. Possible options when this happens:

- **Restrict**
    
- **Cascade**
    
- **Set null / Set default**
    

## The Update Operation

Used to modify attribute values in one or more tuples of a relation **R**.

- Must specify a **condition** to identify tuples to update.
    
- Must ensure **no integrity constraints are violated**.
