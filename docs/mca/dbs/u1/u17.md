# Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schema

In the relational model, a **database state** represents the data stored in all relations at a particular point in time. To ensure **data correctness, consistency, and validity**, various types of **constraints** are imposed on the data.

## Categories of Constraints

Constraints in relational databases are classified into four main types:

1. **Inherent (Model-Based) Constraints**
    
    - Implicit in the relational model.
        
    - Example: All tuples in a relation must be unique (no duplicates).
        
2. **Schema-Based (Explicit) Constraints**
    
    - Defined as part of the database schema using DDL.
        
    - Examples: `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`.
        
3. **Application-Based (Semantic) Constraints**
    
    - Business rules that cannot be enforced through schema alone. Must be enforced through application logic.
        
    - Example: A manager’s salary must be higher than their employees’.
        
4. **Data Dependencies**
    
    - Constraints like **functional dependencies** and **multivalued dependencies**, primarily used during normalization.
        
## Schema-Based (Explicit) Constraints

Explicit constraints are rules written into the schema to **maintain data integrity**.

### a. Domain Constraints

- Each attribute has an associated **domain** (set of valid atomic values).
    
- Values in tuples must come from the domain of the attribute.
    
- Example: `Age` must be a positive integer.
    
### b. Entity Integrity

- Every relation must have a **Primary Key**.
    
- Primary key values cannot be NULL, must be unique.
    
- Ensures that each tuple is uniquely identifiable.
    
### c. Referential Integrity

Ensures consistency across related relations using **foreign keys**.

A **foreign key (FK)** in relation **R1** references the **primary key (PK)** in relation **R2** if:

- The attributes in **FK** have the same domains as the PK in **R2**.
    
- Each FK value in **R1** must either:
    
    - Match a PK value in **R2**, or
        
    - Be **NULL** (if optional).
        
- **R1** = referencing relation
    
- **R2** = referenced relation
    
- FK can also refer to the same relation (**self-referencing**).
    
### d. Key Constraints

Key constraints ensure uniqueness and identify records:

- **Superkey**: Any set of attributes that uniquely identifies tuples.
    
- **Candidate Key**: A minimal superkey (no redundant attributes). meaning no attribute can be removed without losing uniqueness.
    
- **Primary Key**: One selected candidate key; must be unique and not null.
    
- **Alternate Key**: Candidate keys not chosen as the primary key.
    

Other schema-level constraints include:

- **NOT NULL**: Disallows missing values.
    
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures distinct values across rows.
    
- **DEFAULT**: Assigns default value if none provided.
    
- **CHECK**: Validates values using a condition.
    
    - Example: `CHECK (age > 18)`.
        
## Relational Database Schema and State

- A **Relational Database Schema (S)** is a set of relation schemas:  
    **S = {R1, R2, ..., Rm}**
    
- A **Relational Database State (DB)** is a set of relation states at a point in time:  
    **DB = {r1, r2, ..., rm}**
    
- **Integrity Constraints (IC)** are associated with **S** and must hold in every valid state of the database.
    
#### Valid vs. Invalid State

- A **valid state** satisfies all defined constraints.
    
- An **invalid state** violates one or more constraints.
    
## Other Types of Constraints

These are **application-specific rules** or **behavioral constraints** not directly enforced by schema definitions:

### a. Semantic Integrity Constraints

- Example: An employee's salary must be less than their supervisor’s.
    
- Enforced using application code, triggers, or assertions.
    
### b. State Constraints

- Must hold true in any state of the database.
    
- Example: Stock quantity must always be ≥ 0.
    
### c. Transition Constraints

- Govern how values may change from one state to another.
    
- Example: Employee salary must never decrease.
    


## Operations of the Relational Model and Constraint Violations

In the **relational model**, operations are broadly divided into two categories:

### 1. Retrieval Operations

- Involve **queries** that return new relations based on **relational algebra** or **SQL SELECT**.
    
- Do not change the database state.
    
### 2. Update Operations

Update operations **modify the database state**. They include:

- **Insert** – Adds new tuples.
    
- **Delete** – Removes existing tuples.
    
- **Update (Modify)** – Changes values of existing tuples.
    

> All update operations must maintain the **integrity constraints** defined on the database.

## The Insert Operation

- Inserts a new tuple into a relation.
    
- The **DBMS checks for violations** of the following constraints:
    
| Constraint Type           | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain Constraint**     | Attribute value does not match its data type or domain.        |
| **Key Constraint**        | A duplicate primary or candidate key already exists.           |
| **Entity Integrity**      | A `NULL` value is provided for a primary key.                  |
| **Referential Integrity** | A foreign key refers to a non-existent tuple in another table. |

## The Delete Operation

- Removes one or more tuples from a relation.
    
- May **violate referential integrity** if other tuples (in child tables) reference the tuple being deleted.
    

### Handling Referential Integrity Violations on Deletion

When a **parent tuple** is referenced by **foreign keys** in child relations, the DBMS can enforce referential integrity using **one of three actions**:

#### 1. RESTRICT

- Prevents deletion if the tuple is referenced elsewhere.
    
- **Ensures data consistency** and avoids orphaned records.
    
- Example: You cannot delete an employee if their SSN is referenced in the `WORKS_ON` table.
    

#### 2. CASCADE

- Automatically deletes **all referencing tuples** in child tables.
    
- Used when **deleting a parent** should also delete **related child records**.
    
- Example: Deleting an employee deletes all `WORKS_ON` records linked to them.
    

#### 3. SET NULL / SET DEFAULT

- Sets the foreign key in referencing tuples to `NULL` or a **default value**.
    
- Useful if the relationship becomes **optional**.
    
- **Limitation**: If the foreign key is part of the primary key, `SET NULL` violates **entity integrity**.
    

#### Example DDL Implementation:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
  SSN CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE WORKS_ON (
  Pno INT,
  Essn CHAR(9),
  FOREIGN KEY (Essn)
    REFERENCES EMPLOYEE(SSN)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE RESTRICT
);
```

## The Update Operation

- Modifies attribute values in existing tuples.
    
- Requires a **condition** to identify which tuples to modify.
    
- Must preserve all relevant **constraints**.
    

### Common Constraint Violations in Update

- **Domain constraint**: New value does not match expected domain.
    
- **Key constraint**: Update results in duplicate key.
    
- **Entity integrity**: Update sets a primary key to `NULL`.
    
- **Referential integrity**: Update breaks the link with referenced tuple.
