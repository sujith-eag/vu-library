# DBMS Component Modules

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** consists of several integrated components (modules) that handle various aspects of database definition, processing, and management. These modules interact with both the **database** and the **DBMS catalog**, which are typically stored on disk.

The DBMS is composed of several cooperating components:

- DDL compiler for schema processing

- Catalog manager for metadata storage

- Query compiler and optimizer for parsing and improving query performance

- Runtime database processor for executing transactions and queries

- Buffer and data managers for storage and memory efficiency

- Transaction management for reliability and concurrency


## 1. Storage and Buffer Management

- The **database** and the **DBMS catalog** (which stores metadata) reside on disk storage.

- Access to the disk is primarily controlled by the **operating system (OS)**, which schedules low-level read/write operations.

- However, many DBMSs include their own **buffer management module** to improve performance by managing data transfers between disk and main memory.

- Effective buffer management reduces the number of disk I/O operations, which are often the slowest part of database processing.

A higher-level module, the **stored data manager**, controls access to all data stored on disk, whether it belongs to the user database or the DBMS catalog.


## 2. DDL Compiler and Catalog Management

The **Data Definition Language (DDL) compiler** processes schema definitions written in DDL and stores the resulting metadata in the **DBMS catalog**.

The catalog includes information such as:
- File names and sizes
- Data types and names of attributes
- File storage structures and access methods
- Schema mapping information
- Data integrity constraints

The catalog also stores internal statistics and metadata used by other DBMS modules, including the query optimizer and transaction manager.

## 3. Query Processing Modules

#### a. Interactive Query Interface

- Used by **casual users** or those with occasional data access needs.

- Accepts user-submitted queries through a graphical interface or command-line interface.

#### b. Query Compiler

- Parses and validates queries submitted through the interface.

- Checks for correct **syntax**, the validity of **table names**, **attributes**, and **data types**.

- Transforms the query into an **internal representation** suitable for optimization and execution.

#### c. Query Optimizer

Optimizes the internal query representation by:

- Reordering operations

- Eliminating redundancies

- Choosing the most efficient algorithms and access paths

Uses statistical and structural information from the **DBMS catalog** to make optimization decisions.

Outputs an **executable query plan**, which is passed to the runtime database processor.

## 4. Runtime Database Processor

Executes the following:

1. **Privileged commands** (e.g., schema changes)

2. **Optimized query plans**

3. **Predefined transactions** (also called "canned transactions") with runtime parameters

Collaborates with:

- The **system catalog** to retrieve metadata and update statistics

- The **stored data manager** for accessing disk-stored data

- The **buffer manager** for managing memory-resident data blocks

May rely on the OS for low-level I/O, or implement custom I/O handling for better control and performance.

## 5. Transaction Management

Includes modules for:

- **Concurrency control**: Ensures correct execution of simultaneous transactions without conflicts.

- **Backup and recovery**: Protects the database against system failures and allows data restoration.

- These components are closely integrated with the **runtime database processor** to provide full **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transaction properties.
