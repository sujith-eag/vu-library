## Introduction to PL/SQL

* Procedural Language extension for SQL  

* PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.  

* It was developed by Oracle Corporation in the early 90â€™s to enhance the capabilities of SQL.  

* Portable within Oracle data bases  

* Callable from any client  

## Need of PL/SQL

* Acts as host language for stored procedures and triggers.  

* Provides the ability to add middle tier business logic to client/server applications.  

* Provides Portability of code from one environment to another  

* Improves performance of multi-query transactions.  

* Provides error handling  

## Features of PL/SQL

* PL/SQL is tightly integrated with SQL.  

* It offers extensive error checking.  

* It offers numerous data types.  

* It offers a variety of programming structures.  

* It supports structured programming through functions and procedures.  

* It supports object-oriented programming.  

* It supports developing web applications and server pages.  

## Advantages of PL/SQL

* SQL is the standard database language and PL/SQL is strongly integrated with SQL.  

* PL/SQL supports both static and dynamic SQL.  

* PL/SQL allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time.  

* PL/SQL gives high productivity to programmers.  

* PL/SQL saves time on design and debugging.  

* Applications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.  

* PL/SQL provides high security level.  

* PL/SQL provides access to predefined SQL packages.  

* PL/SQL provides support for Object-Oriented Programming.  

* PL/SQL provides support for Developing Web Applications and Server Pages.  

## Structure of PL/SQL

PL/SQL is Block Structured: A block is the basic unit from which all PL/SQL programs are built.  

### Sections of a block
* Header Section  
* Declaration Section (optional)  
* Executable Section (required)  
* Exception Section (optional)  

```plsql
DECLARE
   -- variable declarations
BEGIN
   -- SQL/PLSQL statements
EXCEPTION
   -- error handling
END;
````

Example:

```plsql
DECLARE
  message varchar2(20):= 'Hello, World!';
BEGIN
  dbms_output.put_line(message);
END;
/
```

## Data Types for specific columns

```plsql
Variable_name Table_name.Column_name%type;
```

## Declaring a variable

```plsql
variable_name datatype [NOT NULL := value];
```

## Assigning values

### Direct assignment

```plsql
variable_name := value;
```

### Assignment from database

```plsql
SELECT column_name INTO variable_name 
	FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
```

Example:

```plsql
DECLARE
  var_salary number(10,2);
  var_ssn char(9) := '888665555';
BEGIN
  SELECT salary INTO var_salary FROM employee WHERE ssn=var_ssn;
  dbms_output.put_line(var_salary);
  dbms_output.put_line(var_ssn);
  dbms_output.put_line('The employee ' || var_ssn || ' has salary ' || var_salary);
END;
/
```

## PL/SQL Constants

```plsql
constant_name CONSTANT datatype := VALUE;
```

Valid:

```plsql
DECLARE salary_increase CONSTANT number(3) := 10;
```

Invalid:

```plsql
DECLARE salary_increase CONSTANT number(3);
BEGIN
  salary_increase := 100; -- not allowed
END;
/
```

## PL/SQL Scalar Data Types

|DataType|Description|
|---|---|
|Numeric|Numeric values|
|Character|Alphanumeric values|
|Boolean|Logical values (TRUE, FALSE, NULL)|
|Datetime|Date and time values|

Example:

```plsql
DECLARE
  num1 INTEGER;
  num2 REAL;
  num3 DOUBLE PRECISION;
BEGIN
  null;
END;
/
```

## PL/SQL Boolean Data Types

BOOLEAN values: TRUE, FALSE, NULL

## NULLs in PL/SQL

NULL is not the same as an empty string. Cannot be compared with anything, including itself

## PL/SQL Control Structure

* Conditional Controls  
* Iterative/Loop Controls  
* Exception/Error Controls

## Conditional Controls

### IF statements

```plsql
IF condition THEN
  -- statements
END IF;
```

### IF-ELSE statements

```plsql
IF condition THEN
  -- true block
ELSE
  -- false block
END IF;
```

### CASE statements

```plsql
CASE selector
  WHEN 'value1' THEN S1;
  WHEN 'value2' THEN S2;
  ELSE Sn;
END CASE;
```

Example:

```plsql
DECLARE grade char(1);
BEGIN
  grade := :g;
  CASE grade
    WHEN 'A' THEN dbms_output.put_line('Excellent');
    WHEN 'B' THEN dbms_output.put_line('Very good');
    WHEN 'C' THEN dbms_output.put_line('Well done');
    WHEN 'D' THEN dbms_output.put_line('You passed');
    WHEN 'F' THEN dbms_output.put_line('Better try again');
    ELSE dbms_output.put_line('No such grade');
  END CASE;
END;
/
```

## Loop Structures

### Simple loop

```plsql
LOOP
  -- statements
  EXIT;
END LOOP;
```

### WHILE loop

```plsql
WHILE condition LOOP
  -- statements
END LOOP;
```

### FOR loop

```plsql
FOR i IN [REVERSE] lower..upper LOOP
  -- statements
END LOOP;
```
