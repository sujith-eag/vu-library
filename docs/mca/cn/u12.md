# Networking Devices

**Hub, Switch, Bridge, Router, Brouter, Gateway, Workstation**

## Hub

A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple computers in a LAN and broadcasts data to all ports.

- It receives data from one computer and broadcasts it to all other connected computers.

- Operates at **OSI Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**.
    
- Does **not** learn MAC addresses or perform traffic filtering.
    
- Only one device can transmit at a time, which can cause data **collisions**.
    
- Used mostly in **older networks**; replaced by **switches** in modern setups.
    

## Switch

A switch is a smarter device than a hub. It connects devices within a LAN and forwards data intelligently based on **MAC addresses**.

- It connects multiple devices (like computers, printers, etc.) in a Local Area Network (LAN) and sends data **only to the intended recipient**, not to all devices.
    
- Operates at **OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**.
    
- Reduces collisions by forwarding data to the **correct port**.
    
- Supports **full-duplex communication**, improving speed and efficiency.
    
- Can create **VLANs** (Virtual LANs) for logical network segmentation.
    

## Bridge

A bridge in networking is a device used to connect two different **LANs** and make them act as a **single network**.

- A bridge connects two LAN segments and filters traffic to reduce congestion.
    
- Operates at **OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**.
    
- Learns **MAC addresses** to forward frames selectively.
    
- Improves **traffic flow** between network segments.
    
- Less scalable than switches; typically used in **small networks**.
    

## Router

A router connects different networks and routes packets based on **IP addresses**.

- Operates at **OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer)**.
    
- Routes data between local networks (LAN) and the internet (WAN).
    
- Assigns IP addresses to devices via **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**.
    
- Supports **dynamic routing protocols** such as **RIP**, **OSPF**, and **BGP**.
    
- Performs **NAT (Network Address Translation)** to map private to public IP addresses.
    
- Provides **firewall** and **security features** in modern routers.
    

## Brouter (Bridge Router)

A brouter is a hybrid device that routes known protocols and bridges unknown ones.

- Functions at both **OSI Layer 2 and Layer 3**.
    
- Reduces the need for a separate **bridge** and **router**.
    
- Useful in **legacy systems** that support multiple protocols.
    
- Not commonly used today; replaced by **modern multifunction devices**.
    

## Gateway

A gateway connects networks that use different communication **protocols** and acts as a **translator** between them.

- Operates at **all layers** of the OSI model, especially at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**.
    
- Translates **protocols, data formats**, and **network addresses**.
    
- Examples include **VoIP gateways**, **email gateways**, and **cloud service gateways**.
    
- Enables communication between **heterogeneous systems** (e.g., TCP/IP ↔ AppleTalk).
    

## Workstation

A workstation is a **high-performance computer** used by a single user, typically connected to a network.

- Acts as a **client node** in a client-server network.
    
- Accesses **shared resources** like files, printers, and databases.
    
- Typically more powerful than standard PCs (higher **RAM**, **CPU**, **GPU** specs).
    
- Commonly used in **development**, **design**, **simulation**, and **research** environments.
    


### Network Topology

Network topology is the arrangement of the various elements (like **nodes**, **links**, etc.) in a computer network.

- It represents both the **physical** and **logical** structure of the network.

**Types of Topology:**

- **Bus Topology**
    
- **Star Topology**
    
- **Ring Topology**
    
- **Mesh Topology**
    

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers and other devices within a **limited geographical area**, such as a home, school, office, or building.

- It allows devices like computers, printers, and servers to **communicate**, **share files**, and **access shared resources**, such as the internet or networked storage.
    
- LANs are typically **fast**, **privately managed**, and designed for users in **close physical proximity**.
    

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) connects computers and devices across a **larger area than a LAN**, but smaller than a WAN.

- Typically spans a **city** or a **large campus**.
    
- Used to connect multiple LANs within that area.
    
- Often owned and operated by a **single organization** (e.g., government or large corporation).
    
- Provides **high-speed connectivity** between locations within the **metropolitan region**.
    


## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that spans a **large geographical area**, such as a city, country, or even across continents.

- Used to connect multiple **LANs** and **MANs**.
    
- Typically uses technologies like **leased lines**, **satellite links**, or **fiber optic cables**.
    
- The internet is the **largest example** of a WAN.
    
# Protocol

A **protocol** in computer networking is a standard set of rules that define how computers communicate with each other over a network.

Protocol defines the **Format** and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the action taken on the transmission and/or recieipt of a message or other event.

Protocols define and control how data is:

- **Formatted**
    
- **Transmitted** &  Received
    
- **Processed** between devices on a computer network
    
- What each device should do when something goes wrong

# The Network Edge

The **Network Edge** refers to the end part of a computer network where users and devices (like computers, smartphones, servers, or sensors) connect to the Internet.

- It is the **starting or ending point** of data in the network — where communication with the Internet begins or ends.
* End systems are also referred to as host because they host application programs such as web browsers, server and mail
