# History of the Internet

- **1969** – **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created by the U.S. Department of Defense, marking the beginning of modern networking.
    
- **1971** – ARPANET grows and connects more institutions; the first network **email** is sent.
    
- **1983** – ARPANET adopts the **TCP/IP protocol**, which becomes the standard for future networks.
    
- **1986** – **NSFNET** (National Science Foundation Network) is launched to connect and support academic research across the U.S.
    
- **1990** – ARPANET is decommissioned, having served as the foundation of today’s internet.
    
- **1991** – The **World Wide Web** becomes publicly available, developed by **Tim Berners-Lee**.
    
- **1995** – NSFNET is decommissioned, and the internet becomes fully **commercialized**.
    
- **2000s – Present** – The **Internet expands globally**, enabling services like **cloud computing, IoT**, and **social networking**.

## What is the Internet?

The **Internet** is a **global computer network** providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of **interconnected networks** using standardized communication protocols.

A **Computer Network** is a set of computers **connected together** for the purpose of **sharing resources**.

## NIC (Network Interface Card)

A **Network Interface Card (NIC)** is a hardware component that enables a computer or other device to connect to a network. It acts as a bridge between the device and the network by sending and receiving data.

### Functions:

- Converts data into electrical, optical, or radio signals.
    
- Connects via Ethernet or wirelessly (Wi-Fi).
    
- Typically installed on the motherboard or connected externally.
    

### Types of NICs:

- **Wired NIC** – Uses Ethernet cables (e.g., RJ-45 connector).
    
- **Wireless NIC** – Uses radio signals to connect (Wi-Fi).
    
- **Integrated NIC** – Built directly into the motherboard.
    
- **External NIC** – USB or expansion card NICs.
    

> **Note**: Each NIC has a **unique MAC address** used to identify the device on the network.

### Cables:

- **Straight-Through Cable** – Used to connect different devices (e.g., PC to switch).
    
- **Cross-Over Cable** – Used to connect same devices (e.g., PC to PC, switch to switch).    

## MAC (Media Access Control) Address

A **MAC address** is a **unique identifier** assigned to a device's NIC, used to identify devices at the **data link layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model. Used by **switches and bridges** for data forwarding within LAN.

48-bit (6 bytes) hexadecimal address seperated by `: or -`, shown as: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

Basic Format has two parts:
    
- **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)** – First 24 bits (identifies manufacturer).
        
- **Device Identifier** – Last 24 bits (device-specific/ Unique to device).
        
Permanently assigned by manufacturer, burned into hardware/ ROM (but can be spoofed using software). 

### Types of MAC Addressing:

- **Unicast** – Sent to a specific device.
    
- **Multicast** – Sent to a group of devices.
    
- **Broadcast** – Sent to all devices (`FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`).
    

### MAC Address Commands:

- **Windows**: `getmac`, `ipconfig /all`
    
- **Linux/macOS**: `ifconfig`, `ip link`, or `ip a`

### MAC Filtering:

Routers can use MAC filtering to **allow or deny** specific devices access to the network.

# Internet Protocol (IP)

- **Internet Protocol (IP)** is the network protocol used to deliver packets of data across networks.
    
- It defines the **rules and structure** for how data should be **packaged, addressed, transmitted, and routed** between devices.
    
- IP operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the **OSI model**.
    

# Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)

- An **IP address** is a **numerical label** assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication.
    
- It **uniquely identifies** devices and facilitates **routing of data** between the sender and receiver across local networks or the internet.
    

### Main Functions of an IP Address:

1. **Network Identification (NID)** – Identifies the **network segment** to which the device belongs.
    
2. **Host Identification (HID)** – Identifies the **specific device** within that network segment.
    

- IP addresses are essential for proper **communication between devices** on both **local** and **wide area networks** (LANs and WANs).

# Versions of Internet Protocol Address (IP Address Versions)

Several versions of IP have been defined. Some are in use today, while others were reserved or experimental.

### IP Versions:

- **IPv1 to IPv3**:  
    Early development versions that were never officially deployed.
    
- **IPv4**:  
    The **most widely used** version of IP, based on a **32-bit addressing system**.
    
- **IPv5**:  
    An **experimental** protocol known as **Internet Stream Protocol**.  
    It was **never officially adopted** or publicly implemented.
    
- **IPv6**:  
    The **modern version** of IP, designed to address the **limitations of IPv4**, using a **128-bit addressing scheme** to support vastly more addresses.
    
- **IPv7 to IPv15**:  
    These are either **reserved**, **experimental**, or **unused** in public implementations.

# Classes of IP Addresses (IPv4)

IPv4 addresses are categorized into five different **classes** based on their **starting bits** and **address ranges**. This classification helps in defining the **size of networks** and how many **hosts (devices)** they can support.

- An **IPv4 address** is **32 bits** long and divided into **4 octets** (8 bits each).
    
- The total IPv4 address space is **2³² = 4,294,967,296** unique addresses.
    
- IPv4 addresses are represented in:
    
    - **Binary notation** (e.g., `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`)
        
    - **Dotted-decimal notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
        

Although **IPv6** adoption is increasing, **IPv4 is still widely used** today.

## Private IP Address

- A **private IP address** is an IP address used within an **internal network** (e.g., home, school, office).
    
- These addresses are **not routable** on the public internet.
    
- Devices using private IPs can access the internet **through a router** that uses **NAT (Network Address Translation)**.
    
- **NAT** allows multiple devices to **share a single public IP address** when communicating with external networks.
    

### Common Private IP Address Ranges (IPv4):

| Class | Range                         | Subnet Mask |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| A     | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     | 255.0.0.0   |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   | 255.240.0.0 |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 |

These private ranges are **reserved by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)** and cannot be assigned on the public internet.
