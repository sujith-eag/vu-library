# Application Layer

The **Application Layer** provides services and interfaces directly to end users or to application software. It acts as the interface between the user and the network.

Network applications are the primary drivers of network growth. Over the decades, the Internet has supported several _“killer applications”_, including:

- **1970s–1980s**: Email, remote access, file sharing
    
- **1990s**: World Wide Web, e-commerce
    
- **Late 1990s**: Instant messaging, P2P file sharing
    
- **2000s**: VoIP, video conferencing, YouTube, Netflix, online gaming
    
- **2010s onward**: Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter
    

At the core of network applications are **distributed programs**—software running on multiple end systems (clients and servers) that communicate via a network.

- Example: A web browser (client) communicates with a web server.
    
- Application software is developed for end systems (desktops, servers, mobile devices), not for network core devices (like routers which operates below application layer).
    
- Typical programming languages: C, Java, Python.
    
- This **end-to-end architecture** supports rapid innovation and scalable deployment.


## Key Concepts in the Application Layer

1. Network Application Architectures
2. Processes Communicating
3. Transport Services Available to Applications
4. Transport Services Provided by the Internet
5. Application-Layer Protocols


### 1. Network Application Architectures

Before developing a network application, it’s essential to select an appropriate architecture, which defines how components are distributed across systems.

#### Client-Server Architecture

- A **centralized server** is always-on and serves multiple clients.
    
- The server typically has a **fixed IP address** and is hosted in **data centers** to handle large-scale requests.
    
- **Clients** initiate communication; **servers** respond.
    
- Examples: HTTP (Web), FTP, Email, Telnet
    
- Highly scalable using modern cloud infrastructure (e.g., Amazon, Google).
    

#### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

- No dedicated central server; all **peers communicate directly**.
    
- Peers act as **both clients and servers**, sharing bandwidth, storage, and processing.
    
- Examples: BitTorrent (file sharing), Skype (VoIP), IPTV platforms
    
- **Advantages**: Scalable and cost-effective.
    
- **Challenges**:
    
    - ISP-friendliness: Heavy upload traffic impacts ISPs.
        
    - Security: Harder to defend against malicious peers.
        
    - Incentives: Encouraging peers to share resources is critical.

### 2. Processes Communicating

A **process** is a running program (like a browser or email client). 

When processes run on the same system, they use OS-managed **inter-process communication (IPC)**; when on different systems, they use **network communication**.

In networked systems:

- Communication is between **processes on different end systems**.
    
- They communicate by **sending messages** across the network such as requesting web page, downloading web file or sending mail.
    
- A **client process** initiates contact.
    
- A **server process** waits and responds to incoming requests.

### 3. Transport Services and Protocols

Network applications rely on **transport layer protocols** (like TCP or UDP) to send data between processes. The **application layer protocols** define the **format and rules** of communication (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is an application-layer protocol used for transferring files between systems on a TCP/IP network.

- Allows file upload/download between client and server.
    
- Requires **authentication** (username & password).
    
- FTP uses **two TCP connections**:
    
    - **Control connection** (port **21**) – for sending commands
        
    - **Data connection** (port 20) – for actual file transfer
        
- FTP is **stateful**: session information is maintained during transfer.
    

### FTP Architecture

Unlike HTTP, which uses a single connection, FTP uses this **dual-channel** design for greater flexibility in file operations.

| **Connection Type** | **Port / Behavior**                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Control Connection  | TCP Port 21 (Persistent)                    |
| Data Connection     | Dynamically assigned ports (Non-persistent) |

---

### Common FTP Commands

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`USER <username>`|Sends the username to the server|
|`PASS <password>`|Sends the password for authentication|
|`LIST`|Lists files/directories in the current directory|
|`RETR <filename>`|Downloads the specified file from the server|
|`STOR <filename>`|Uploads the specified file to the server|

### FTP Reply Codes

| **Reply Code** | **Meaning**                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `331`          | Username OK, password required                        |
| `125`          | Data connection already open; transfer starting       |
| `425`          | Can't open data connection                            |
| `452`          | Error writing file (e.g., insufficient storage space) |
