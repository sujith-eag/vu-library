# After Intro (Before Dance)

**Sujith**: I heartly Welcome all our MCA faulty, classmates and mainly our seniors, for whom we have planned all these. I walcome you all to today's events.

This day marks the last informal day of your college, so we have planned rather in a hurry few fun activities and performances for our seniors.

This is your day, we hope we'll be able to make it little more special and memorable day, so please participate, have fun and enjoy.

Joining me in anchoring today is samskruthi shetty

> **Samskruthi** : 


**Sujith**: 
Samskruthi, i was thinking would it not be nice if the faculties who taught our seniors did the anchoring for them.

> **Samskruthi**: Thats a nice idea. How about Komala mam introducing the first event in her 2x Speed english.

Ha, Good morning students, how are you all doing, 
hope all are doing well only..

Why so low energy even before the event started?
no josh at all, did everyone have breakfast?
Noo!  

You should take care of your health first right,
Your juniors have prepared so much activities for you guys 
and it will be late by for lunch, 
how can you sit and participate in everything in empty stomach.. . 

Make sure you have your breakfast ok, 
We don't even know if your juniors will provide food or not,

It is wonderful seeing you all studets,

Was it fun, your juniors have bunked too many classes 
to prepare this event for you people only today.

As HoD of the department it is my responsibility to make sure 
all happens well, 

I have already told you many times it is important for your 
placement how many Hackathons, ideathons you attend and win..

As we are are the very end of todays events, on this special

give some parting words to the seniour batch
