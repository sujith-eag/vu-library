# After Intro (Before Dance)

**Sujith**: I heartly Welcome all our MCA faulty, classmates and mainly our seniors, for whom we have planned all these. I walcome you all to today's events.

This day marks the last informal day of your college, so we have planned rather in a hurry few fun activities and performances for our seniors.

This is your day, we hope we'll be able to make it little more special and memorable day, so please participate, have fun and enjoy.

Joining me in anchoring today is samskruthi shetty

> **Samskruthi** : 


**Sujith**: 
Samskruthi, i was thinking would it not be nice if the faculties who taught our seniors did the anchoring for them.

> **Samskruthi**: Thats a nice idea. How about Komala mam introducing the first event in her 2x Speed english.

Hey, common ya, Why so low energy, early morning
no josh at all, the events didn't even start yet?

are you all sleepy?
did everyone have breakfast?
Noo!

What is this, yes i understand event is important, 
but you should take care of your health first right,

Your juniors have prepared so much activities for 
you guys and it will be late for lunch, 
how can you sit and participate in everything 
in empty stomach...

Make sure you always have your breakfast ok, 
I don't even know if your juniors are providing
food for you or not, i'll find out and 
get back to you on that..  

>>>>>>>>>
Haaa OK OK they are saying they have arranged,
but that will be after the events ok, 
first we'll finish the events.

___

Samskrithi, i had asked you to find out 
about something right? 
did you find out?

>>>>>>>
No, How can you so simply say no,
I don't understand why you people are 
becoming so lazy nowadayas, hardly it would take 
two minutes to find out.

I never forget what i had asked you to do,
Ask your seniors did i ever forget what 
work i had given, Noo right...

i never forget, and i will keep on asking 
till you find out and tell me.

even though it was last year i still 
remember what i had asked to find out
for your seniors also because they never 
gave any answer.

___

Ok Ok lets, not worry about that today,

does everyone know what is murphys law, 
"You are fine and i am fine then everything is fine"

So, all of you are here to enjoy and 
i know you are all waiting for that only,

We have your juniours ready to entertain you
with a wonderful dance performance,

So have fun, please enjoy

It is wonderful seeing you all studets, 
full bright and having fun in your farewell day.

Was it fun, your juniors have bunked 
soo many classes to prepare this event
for you people only today.

Your juniors did well no, give them round of applause,

From 1997 soo many farewells i have seen,
As HoD of the department it is my responsibility 
to make sure all happens well, 

I have already told you many times it is important 
for you people for placement how many Hackathons you attend, 
ideathons you attend and also told you soo many times
to attend classes regularly or you will be NE 
Not Eligible..

But today As we are are the very end of todays events, 
on this special day also, 
i want to tell you some parting words, 

it would be best if the real HoD Ajitha mam comes 
on the stage to give some parting words to the seniour batch
