In Bash, variables can be defined from the command line and used later in the same shell session or from within a script. All variables are typically capitalized but not a requirement.

When a variable is available throughout the environment for use, not just one session or script, it is called an **environment variable**.

#### env - Environment Variables

The `env` command can be used to see all the environment variables defined (these can vary across distributions).

```bash {frame="none"}
sujith@sujith-Latitude-7490:~/Desktop$ env
SHELL=/bin/bash
SESSION_MANAGER=local/sujith-Latitude-7490:@/tmp/.ICE-unix/1537,unix/sujith-Latitude-7490:/tmp/.ICE-unix/1537
QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1
PWD=/home/sujith/Desktop
LOGNAME=sujith
HOME=/home/sujith
USERNAME=sujith
IM_CONFIG_PHASE=1
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
USER=sujith
GNOME_TERMINAL_SERVICE=:1.132
DISPLAY=:0
SHLVL=1
PATH=/home/sujith/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/snap/bin
GDMSESSION=ubuntu
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus
NVM_BIN=/home/sujith/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin
_=/usr/bin/env
OLDPWD=/home/sujith
```

These environment variables can also be viewed by using **`echo`** where `string` is the name of the environment variable. To output the value of a variable, use the `$` sign before the variable name.

```bash {frame="none"}
sujith@sujith-Latitude-7490:~/Desktop$ echo $USER; echo $SHELL; echo $PWD; echo $OLDPWD;
sujith
/bin/bash
/home/sujith/Desktop
/home/sujith
```

### Common Bash Environment Variables

- **`DESKTOP_SESSION`**: Name of the desktop GUI (e.g., `gnome`)
- **`HISTSIZE`**: Size of the history list (e.g., `1000`)
- **`LANG`**: The specified language and character encoding (e.g., `en_US.UTF-8`)
- **`MAIL`**: Location of the user's main mail storage
- **`OLDPWD`**: The previous working directory (prior to the current one)
- **`PATH`**: List of directories to search for executable programs
- **`PS1`**: Defines the user prompt
- **`SHELL`**: The userâ€™s default shell

**`PATH`** is a crucial environment variable in Linux. It contains a list of directories in which the shell searches for executable programs.
Most are found in `/user/bin    /user/sbin`

```bash {frame="none"}
PATH=/home/sujith/.nvm/versions/node/v20.17.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/snap/bin
```

Without the `PATH` variable, you would need to specify the full path to the executable before running any command.

### **Defining Variables**

To store a value in a variable, use an **assignment statement**. The syntax is `VAR=VALUE` with no spaces around the equal sign. We can define new variables or redefine existing ones.

```bash {frame="none"}
$ FIRST=Sujith
$ LAST=kumar
$ echo $FIRST $LAST
Sujith Kumar
```

**Using Single Quotes**:    
When using single quotes (`' '`), the Bash interpreter treats the content literally and does not expand the value of variables.      
So it will not apply `$` to retrieve the value from variables.

```bash {frame="none"}
$ FULL_NAME='$FIRST $LAST'
$ echo $FULL_NAME
$FIRST $LAST
```

**Using Double Quotes**:     
If there is any blank space in the Value being assigned, then value has to be in `" "`      
When using double quotes (`" "`), the Bash interpreter will expand variables.

```bash {frame="none"}
$ FULL_NAME="$FIRST $LAST"
$ echo $FULL_NAME
Sujith Kumar
```

If a command like `pwd` is stored in a variable and called, Bash will execute it.

`unset variable` will remove the variable from the list of variables.     
`readonly variable` will not allow the variable to be reassigned.    

```bash {frame="none"}
$ psite=~/Desktop/website/site
$ cd $psite

$ pnote=~/Desktop/obsid/notes
$ cd $pnote

$ size=`wc -c < file.text`
```

The Shell Order of Processing can be:    
* Parsing : Breaking command into words with space or tab as delimiter.
* Variable evaluation : All `$` prefixed strings are evaluated as variables, unless quoted or escaped.  
* Command Substitution : Any command surrounded by back quotes are executed by the shell which then replaces the standard output of the command into the command line.     
* Redirection : Looks for `< > >>` to open files they point to.
* Wildcard Interpretation : Replacing with matching file names.
* PATH Evaluation : Searching for the command in directories.

**Escape Character (`\`)**:    
The escape character is used to tell the Bash interpreter to treat the following character literally and not interpret it.     
`\$$AMOUNT` escapes the first `$`, so it is not interpreted as a variable.

**Other Escape Characters**:     
- `\\` : outputs a backslash (`\`)
- `\b` : backspace
- `\n` : newline
- `\t` : tab
- `\!` , `\$` , `\&` , `\;` , `\'` , `\"` : escaping special symbols

Putting a string of command in `' '` single quotes will also work as escaping all the characters in it.

> [!Important]
> All variables and aliases defined in the terminal in a session in that environment is temporary by default and will get erased after the terminal session ends.
>To make it permanent, they need to be defined in the configuration files that are loaded when the shell starts like `~/.bashrc`, for system wide environment variables like `/etc/environemnt`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`

### **Aliases**

An **alias** is used to define a shortcut for a command.    
Similar to defining a variable, name can be assigned to a command to shorten its execution.

To define an alias, use an assignment statement:    
`alias name="command"`    
The name is the alias, and the command is the Linux command it represents.

```bash {frame="none"}
alias ..="cd .."
alias ~="cd ~"
alias lss=less
alias sl=ls
alias rm='rm -i'  # -i for interactive mode
```
`rm` is given in single quotes to input the interactive version.

```bash {frame="none"}
alias psite="cd ~/Desktop/Sites/Personal"
```


You can view all the predefined aliases by typing `alias`:
```bash {frame="none"}
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
```


To remove an alias, use the `unalias` command:

```bash {frame="none"}
unalias ll
```
