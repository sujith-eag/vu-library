       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of echo, which usually super‐
       sedes  the  version described here.  Please refer to your shell's docu‐
       mentation for details about the options it supports.

       NOTE: printf(1) is a preferred alternative, which does not have  issues
       outputting option-like strings.
